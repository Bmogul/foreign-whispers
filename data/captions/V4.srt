1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,800
General Mark Millie completed a

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,040
four-year term as chairman of the Joint

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,440
Chiefs of Staff the nation's highest

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,000
ranking military officer on September

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,559
30th he told us he spent most of his

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,039
time working to avoid a direct conflict

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,480
with Russia and China while the country

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,039
watched him have a very public falling

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,400
out with former president Trump the man

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,680
who picked him for the job General

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,519
Millie's times serving President Joe

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,039
Biden had its own challenges including

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,360
America's calamitous withdrawal from

14
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,800
Afghanistan as well as providing Ukraine

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,520
with billions of dollars worth of

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,399
American military equipment a few hours

17
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,960
before we sat down with the general at

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
the Pentagon he'd had his final phone

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
call with the commander of Ukraine's

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,239
armed

21
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,359
forces the story will continue in a

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,520
moment the counter offensive that the

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,079
ukrainians are running is still ongoing

24
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,320
um the progress as uh many many people

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,960
have noted is slow but it is steady and

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,199
they are making progress on a day-to-day

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,560
basis but expelling 200,000 Russian

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,119
soldiers No Easy Task very hard very

29
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,640
hard how long is this going to look like

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,240
this a year five years well you can't

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,439
put a Time on it but it'll be a

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,520
considerable length of time and it's

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,920
going to be long and hard and very

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
bloody Russia occupies 41,000 square

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,640
miles of Ukraine the front line extends

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
about the distance from Atlanta to

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,479
Washington DC in Congress this past week

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
Republicans ended Kevin McCarthy's

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
speakership and for now more Aid to

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,360
Ukraine according to the White House of

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,759
the 113 billion already committed

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,920
there's only enough left to last a few

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,799
more months with all of the issues

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,799
facing Americans at home why is this

45
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,799
worth it if Ukraine loses and Putin wins

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,119
I think you would be certainly

47
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,880
increasing if not doubling your defense

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,759
budget in the years ahead and you will

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,200
increase the probability of a great

50
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,840
power war in the next 10 to 15 years I

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,320
think it' be a very dangerous situation

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,960
if if Putin's allowed to win Ukraine

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,360
Russia obviously is what drives this

54
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,640
meeting today the chairman of the Joint

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,879
Chiefs is the commander and Chief's

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,400
principal military adviser but commands

57
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,200
no troops in battle I am obligated uh

58
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,680
regardless of consequences to give my

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,879
advice to the president but no president

60
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,800
is obligated to follow that advice this

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,920
past August General Millie invited us to

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,200
board the USS Constitution in Boston

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,120
Harbor not far from where he grew up

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,319
we're the only uh military in the world

65
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,879
that swear an oath not to a king a queen

66
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,200
a tyrant a wouldbe tyrant or a dictator

67
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
we swear an oath to an idea the idea

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,040
that is American it's and it's embodied

69
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
in that document the Constitution which

70
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
sets up our form of government in 2021

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,680
General Millie had counseled President

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,720
Biden to keep 2,500 troops in and around

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Cobell instead Mr Biden ordered a

74
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,040
complete withdrawal to end America's

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,560
longest war after 20 years the disaster

76
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,840
that followed will be part of both of

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,200
their legacies I go through the entire

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,959
uh withdrawal from uh Afghanistan

79
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,040
chapter and verse all the time that was

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,799
a a strategic failure for the United

81
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,720
States the enemy occupied the capital

82
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,040
city of the country that you were

83
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,360
supporting so to me uh that hurts it

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,319
hurts a big way but no matter what pain

85
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,799
I feel or anyone else feels nothing

86
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,680
comes even close to the pain of those

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,400
that were killed to those who served in

88
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,680
Afghanistan for two decades and lost

89
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,360
family members and friends and wonder

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
was it worth it that's always the

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
question right so 2461 killed in action

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,120
by the enemy in Afghanistan over 20

93
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
years was it worth it look at I can't

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,200
answer that for other people this is a

95
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,519
tough business that we're in this

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,400
military business it's unforgiving The

97
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,760
Crucible of combat's unforgiving people

98
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
die they lose their arms they lose their

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,319
legs it's an incredibly difficult uh

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,360
life but is it worth it look around you

101
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,439
uh look ask yourself the question uh for

102
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,159
me I've answered it many many times over

103
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,319
and that's why I stay in uniform and

104
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,239
that's why I maintain my oath his

105
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:04,920
commitment to that oath would be both

106
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,000
tested and questioned by Donald Trump

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
while their relationship began with kind

108
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,599
words uh Mark Milly he's a great

109
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,439
gentleman he's a great Patriot he's a

110
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:17,040
great Soldier after the January 6th

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,359
Insurrection the two men would not speak

112
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,960
again what do we want we their public

113
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,919
estrangement started in the spring of

114
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,800
2020 when protests for racial Justice

115
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,280
some violent spread across the country

116
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,320
including to Washington DC perhaps more

117
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,960
than any other chairman in the role you

118
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,520
have become ins snarled in politics and

119
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,759
arguably threats to the Constitution

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
what have you learned from that well I

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,320
think it's important to to keep your

122
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,759
North Star which is the Constitution we

123
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,080
the military are not only apolitical we

124
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,440
are nonpartisan you can't pick sides

125
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,039
June 1st 2020 was that a turning point

126
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,240
for you as chairman I think it was yeah

127
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
I realized that

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,320
stepped into a political Minefield and I

129
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,080
shouldn't

130
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,680
have he's talking about the day when

131
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,520
President Trump threatened to invoke the

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,280
Insurrection act and deploy the US Army

133
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,520
to put down the unrest on America's

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,600
streets on the evening of June 1st after

135
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,520
demonstrators near the White House were

136
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,560
removed by

137
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,360
force chairman Millie dressed in battle

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,520
fatigues joined president Trump and

139
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,039
members of his cabinet in a march across

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,919
lafay Square to St John's Church where

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,120
Mr Trump posed for

142
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,000
photographs 10 days later General Millie

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,319
apologized in a speech to graduates of

144
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,759
the National Defense University my

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
presence in that moment and in that

146
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,120
environment created a perception of the

147
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,080
military involved in domestic Politics

148
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,319
as a commissioned uniformed officer it

149
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,880
was a mistake that I have learned from

150
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,680
it's rare for a chairman to apologize

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,720
publicly well you know I grew up here in

152
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,840
Boston I'm Irish Catholic and my mother

153
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
and father taught me that when you make

154
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,199
a mistake you admit it you got a

155
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,880
confession you say 10 hell Mar is an Al

156
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
father everybody makes mistakes and and

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
the key is how you deal with a mistake

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
after you apologized former president

159
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,280
Trump said you choked like a

160
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,720
dog yeah I'm not going to comment on

161
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,199
anything the former president has said

162
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,919
or not said General Millie did tell us

163
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,080
he was so disillusioned with the former

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,199
president's actions he nearly resigned

165
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,039
instead according to Former Defense

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,479
secretary Mark esper he and the general

167
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,319
made a pact to protect the military from

168
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,720
becoming politicized or misused it's

169
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,639
also been reported that you spent

170
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,560
several days several drafts of

171
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,160
resignation letters right I was very

172
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,639
struck by the one that was published in

173
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,680
which you said to the president it is my

174
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,720
deeply held belief that you are ruining

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,080
the international order causing

176
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,639
significant damage to our country

177
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,319
overseas that was fought so hard by the

178
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,000
greatest Generation in

179
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,520
1945 that generation has fought against

180
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,000
fascism has fought against Nazism has

181
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
fought against extremism it's now

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,280
obvious to me that you don't understand

183
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,720
that World Order you don't think Donald

184
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,400
Trump understood what World War II was

185
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,840
fought over I don't know what uh

186
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,039
president former president Trump uh

187
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,520
understood about World War II or or or

188
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,000
or anything else uh I I can tell you

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,639
that from 1914 to

190
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,360
1945 150 million people or thereabouts

191
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,840
were slaughtered in the conduct of great

192
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,240
power war and in 1945 the United States

193
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,039
took the initiative and drafted up a set

194
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,919
of rules that govern the world to this

195
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,560
day those rules are under stress

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
internationally President Putin is a

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,080
direct frontal assault on those rules uh

198
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,159
China is trying to revise those rules to

199
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,879
their own benefit but that's one thing

200
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,560
to say that China is threatening that

201
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,440
World Order and Russia is threatening

202
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,520
that world order to say that the

203
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,319
Commander in Chief Donald Trump was

204
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,319
ruining the international order in

205
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,400
causing significant damage what did you

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
see that caused you to write that I I

207
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
would say that it's got to be more than

208
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,280
walking into Lafayette Square and

209
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,879
uniform there was a wide variety of

210
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,599
initiatives that were ongoing one of

211
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
them of course was with drawing troops

212
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,039
out of NATO those were initiatives that

213
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,360
placed at risk um you know I think

214
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
America's rolling the world now that is

215
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,599
uh the opposite of uh what my parents

216
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,240
and and uh 18 million others wore the

217
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,280
uniform for World War II to defeat

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520

all right Cadets in a few of the young

249
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,399
officers whose language skills are

250
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,120
currently in high demand I speak Chinese

251
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,959
sir Chinese is really really important

252
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,120
to us does anybody else speak Chinese

253
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,519
whoa 1 two 3 4 five if you speak Chinese

254
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,480
if you don't mind I'd like to get your

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,200
names uh and we'll see where life takes

256
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,600
you guys we the United States need to

257
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,240
take the challenge the military

258
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,120
challenge of China extraordinarily

259
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,440
seriously how concerned are you that

260
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,240
military to military Communications are

261
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,079
not happening right now with China yeah

262
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,959
I think we need to get that established

263
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
uh we had them for a period of time and

264
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
they've dropped off so channels of

265
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
communication are important in order to

266
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,600
deescalate in time of Crisis general

267
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,120
Millie says he held a total of five

268
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,000
calls with his Chinese military

269
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,800
counterparts during the Trump and Biden

270
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,959
administrations but it was his last two

271
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,839
calls during the final months of the

272
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,200
Trump presidency that got the attention

273
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,000
of the press Congress and the former

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
president himself why did you think it

275
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,200
was so important to call your Chinese

276
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,399
military counterpart in the aftermath of

277
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,079
the January 6th attacks that's an

278
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,639
example of deescalation so there was

279
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,680
clear indications uh that the Chinese

280
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,560
were very concerned about what they were

281
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,240
observing here in the United States you

282
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,399
see some movement of Chinese military

283
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,480
equipment I w't go over anything

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,279
classified um so I won't discuss exactly

285
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,360
what we saw or didn't see or what we

286
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,720
heard or didn't hear I will just say

287
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,760
that uh there was clear indications that

288
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,720
the Chinese are very concerned president

289
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,920
Trump recently said that your dealings

290
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,240
with China were so egregious that in

291
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,000
Times Gone by the punishment would have

292
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,800
been

293
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,240
death that's right he said that but for

294
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,320
the record was there anything

295
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,240
inappropriate or treasonous about the

296
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
calls you made to China absolutely not

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,120
zero none and not only that they were

298
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,639
authorized and they coordinated uh

299
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,240
Congress knows that we've answered these

300
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,720
questions several different times in

301
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
writing were you giving the Chinese

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,959
information about thinking of the

303
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,760
president of the United States the

304
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,240
specific conversation was I think in

305
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,959
accordance with the intent of the

306
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,680
Secretary of Defense which was to make

307
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,120
sure the Chinese knew that we were not

308
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,079
going to attack them why did the Chinese

309
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,120
think that the US under then president

310
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,560
Trump was going to attack them the

311
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,680
Chinese were concerned about uh what

312
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,839
what is commonly referred to in in the

313
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,079
English language like an October

314
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
surprise Wag the Dog sort of thing uh

315
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
they were wrong they were not reading us

316
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,639
right look at the president Trump was

317
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
not going to attack China uh and they

318
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,560
needed to know that China Russia and the

319
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,240
war in Ukraine are now the problem of

320
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,639
his successor Air Force General Charles

321
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,000
Q Brown

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,839
Jr there are also areas of concern

323
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,040
closer to home last year the Army missed

324
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
recruiting numbers by 15,000 Soldiers

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,279
the worst shortfall in decades

326
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,800
confidence in the US military is at its

327
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,399
lowest in two decades do you bear any

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,600
personal responsibility for that

329
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,279
absolutely I think I think as the leader

330
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,160
of the military the uniform military I

331
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,079
think that I am part of that for sure I

332
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,240
think the walk from the White House to

333
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,480
the St John's Church I think that uh

334
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
helped create some of that I think the

335
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,279
withdrawal from Afghanistan uh helped

336
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,600
create some of that but I would also say

337
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
the United States military is still one

338
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
of the most respected institutions in

339
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,199
the United States by a long shot uh by

340
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,279
huge margin you know I I think we've uh

341
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,800
taken a slip back a little bit and I

342
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,839
think we need to improve on

343
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,880
that General Mark Milly on the future of

344
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,160
warfare does it make war more likely it

345
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,199
could at 60 Minutes overtime.com in the

346
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,880
character of War which is
