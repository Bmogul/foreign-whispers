1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,959
tonight Scott Pelley reports from

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,359
Ukraine where he sat down with president

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,099
velodimir zielinski in the capital keep

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,039
the story will continue in a moment

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,320
we met president zielinski as he

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,420
prepared to depart key for the United

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,000
States this week he will speak at the

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,300
U.N and meet President Biden it is a

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,480
critical time U.S officials tell us that

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,380
over nearly 600 days almost half a

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,899
million troops have been killed or

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,379
wounded both sides altogether

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,440
part of the cost so far of Vladimir

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,040
Putin's unprovoked invasion we spoke to

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,860
zielinski on Thursday he told us that

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,399
his people are dying every day to

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,579
prevent World War III

18
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,219
um

19
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,140
we're defending the values of the whole

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,019
world zielinski said and these are

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,180
Ukrainian people who are paying the

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,200
highest price

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,659
we are truly fighting for our freedom we

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,000
are dying

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,580
we're not fiction we're not a book we're

26
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,340
fighting for real with a nuclear state

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,220
that threatens to destroy the world

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,040
the United States has contributed about

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,460
70 billion dollars to your war effort

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,060
and I wonder if you expect that level of

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,579
support to continue

32
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,259
the United States of America is

33
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,479
supporting Ukraine financially and I'm

34
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,979
grateful for this

35
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,900
I just think they're not supporting only

36
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,399
Ukraine alone if Ukraine Falls Putin

37
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,040
will surely go further what will the

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,619
United States of America do when Putin

39
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,899
reaches the Baltic states when he

40
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,780
reaches the Polish border he will

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,600
this is a lot of money we have a lot of

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,720
gratitude what else must Ukraine do for

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,879
everyone to measure our huge gratitude

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,760
we are dying in this war

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,160
look if Ukraine Falls what will happen

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
in 10 years just think about it if the

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,340
Russians reach Poland what's next a

48
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,840
third world war

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,260
what will it take another 70 billion

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,379
yeah

51
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:36,239
I don't have an answer the whole world

52
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,340
has to decide whether we want to stop

53
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,800
Putin or whether we want to start the

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,280
beginning of a World War

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,980
we can't change Putin Russian Society

56
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,800
has lost the respect of the world they

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,440
elected him and re-elected him and

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,940
raised a second Hitler they did this we

59
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,599
cannot go back in time but we can stop

60
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,540
it here

61
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,580
Ukraine stopped the Russian advance but

62
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,060
at a terrible cost ruined cities

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,319
millions of refugees Untold thousands of

64
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,099
dead

65
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,800
all four Vladimir Putin's nation

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,959
building vanity

67
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,959
today the war is fought on a 700 mile

68
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,379
front the red area is the 20 percent of

69
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,920
Ukraine still occupied by Russia this is

70
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,319
where Western donated tanks were

71
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,540
supposed to punch through cutting the

72
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,220
Russian Force in half

73
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,040
but trenches minefields and artillery

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,760
stopped the armored Advance now it's an

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,340
artillery duel with each side firing

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,180
about 40 000 shells a day

77
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,080
Ukrainian infantry is advancing bloody

78
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
yards at a time

79
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,580
it's World War One

80
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,680
with drones

81
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,379
how would you describe the fighting at

82
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,780
the front

83
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,980
um

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,599
it's a difficult question I'll be

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,120
completely honest with you we have the

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,760
initiative this is a plus

87
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,739
the Russian offensive and we moved into

88
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,560
a counter-offensive but despite that

89
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,860
it's not very fast it is important that

90
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,199
we are moving forward every day and

91
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,699
liberating territory you have about six

92
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,280
weeks of good weather left and I wonder

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,560
after that point will the front be

94
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,860
frozen in place

95
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,720
we need to liberate our territory as

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,360
much as possible and move forward even

97
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,000
if it's less than half a mile or a

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,060
hundred yards we must do it we can't

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,120
lose time forget about the weather and

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,759
the like in places that we can't get

101
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,580
through in an armored vehicle let's fly

102
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,639
if we can't fly let's send drones

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,340
we mustn't give Putin a break

104
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,639
if the front is stationary Ukrainian

105
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,220
drones have vaulted into Russia itself

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,820
hitting the Kremlin warplanes and Moscow

107
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,880
high-rises officially Ukraine does not

108
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,940
acknowledge these attacks the drone

109
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,280
strikes in Russia are being done on your

110
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,539
orders

111
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,620
no not on your order well you know how

112
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,080
is this happening at the shore you know

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,360
we don't shoot at the territory of the

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,100
Russian Federation

115
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,979
we decided to try the question another

116
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,120
way what message is being sent with

117
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,160
these drone strikes in Russia

118
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,900
you do know that we use our partners

119
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,180
weapons on the territory of Ukraine only

120
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,000
and this is true but these are not

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,419
punitive operations such as they carry

122
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,960
out killing civilians but Russia needs

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,900
to know that wherever it is whichever

124
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,419
place they use for launching missiles to

125
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,960
strike Ukraine Ukraine has every moral

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,380
right to send a response to those places

127
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,500
we are responding to them saying your

128
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,740
sky is not as well protected as you

129
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,750
think

130
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,900
[Music]

131
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,720
last winter it was Ukrainian Skies that

132
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,000
were filled with missiles in a Russian

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,840
bombardment to destroy power plants

134
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,000
Millions shivered in the dark

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,120
with winter approaching again zielinski

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,160
had this warning

137
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,300
they must know if you cut off our power

138
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,000
deprive us of electricity deprive us of

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,600
water the privacy of gasoline you need

140
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,419
to know

141
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,479
we have the right to do it to you

142
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,060
Russia takes Solinski seriously now

143
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,699
because Putin's Mass invasion was a

144
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:06,419
fiasco the red marks where Ukraine

145
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,600
stopped Russia's Advance last year

146
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,960
it also marks the stain of Russia's war

147
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,440
crimes Mr President in traveling around

148
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Ukraine for the last year and a half

149
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,160
we spoke to people in bombed out schools

150
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,319
in chernoheve

151
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,960
we've seen destroyed apartment blocks in

152
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,360
borodianca a bombed Hospital in isium

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,840
civilians in a mass grave in bucha these

154
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,300
are not military targets

155
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,080
what is Vladimir Putin trying to do

156
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,280
to break us

157
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,860
and by choosing civilian targets Putin

158
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,039
wanted to achieve exactly this to break

159
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,240
us this person who has made his way with

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,300
such bloody actions with everything he

161
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,199
has said cannot be trusted there is no

162
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,199
trust in such a person because he has

163
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,979
not been a human being for a long time

164
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,740
the Russians have suffered Grievous

165
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,060
losses

166
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,180
without resorting to nuclear weapons

167
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,520
and I wonder if you believe that the

168
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,080
threat of nuclear war is now behind us

169
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
I think he's going to continue

170
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,940
threatening

171
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,979
he's waiting for the United States to

172
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,800
become less stable he thinks that's

173
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,659
going to happen during the U.S election

174
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:44,459
he'll be looking for instability in

175
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,180
Europe and the United States of America

176
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,820
he will use the risk of using nuclear

177
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,180
weapons to fuel that instability he will

178
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,459
keep on threatening

179
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,040
that U.S election he mentioned worries

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,320
him his negotiations with President

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,740
Biden have been contentious at times but

182
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,959
zielinski tends to get what he asks for

183
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,200
even if in zelinski's opinion it's

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,720
generally six months too late

185
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,019
this week zelinski will press Mr Biden

186
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,019
for missiles with longer range Congress

187
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,560
is debating another 24 billion dollar

188
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,940
package

189
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,500
and if Ukraine had enough of these

190
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,660
modern systems we would have already

191
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,180
restored the territorial Integrity of

192
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,899
Ukraine we would have already done that

193
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:40,880
these systems exist are you safe here

194
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,160
we first met zielinski not long after

195
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,740
the invasion when his office was a

196
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,740
blacked out bunker be careful now a year

197
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,620
and a half later we noticed a difference

198
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,500
as we were setting up the interview the

199
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,860
former actor used his talent to mask the

200
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,160
strain he smiled at a compliment to his

201
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,519
wife yeah so great and then instantly he

202
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,240
seemed pulled beneath a depth no one can

203
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,140
know

204
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,959
we don't know what he was thinking it

205
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,000
looked like empathy

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,560
for the Lost

207
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,470
and for those who might be saved

208
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,240

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,200
Russia have lost their professional

215
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
armies now the forces are made up of

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,320
volunteers draftees and in Russia's case

217
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,620
prison inmates

218
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,420

222
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,680
to you

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,959

225
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,640
me proud that we have such strong people

226
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,779
because this is a big risk a big risk

227
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,300
you can definitely lose your life for

228
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,120
the sake of saving other lives and when

229
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,339

230
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,220
general I mean my own life the lives of

231
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,100
