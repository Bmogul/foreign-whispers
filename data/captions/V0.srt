1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,800
Israel has begun what prime minister

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,040
Benjamin Netanyahu calls the second

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,519
stage of the war by expanding its

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,559
military ground operations in Gaza we

5
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:13,759
spoke with vice president kamla Harris

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,559
this past week as the Biden

7
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:17,560
Administration was trying to balance

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,519
Israel's need to retaliate against Hamas

9
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,720
with the urgent need to get relief to

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,480
the Palestinian people vice president

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,960
Harris told us she is also involved in

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,119
the administration's efforts on the war

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,279
in Ukraine as well as countless

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,399
intractable problems including gun

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,079
violence at home but with the Middle

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,000
East on a Razor's Edge we started our

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,120
conversation

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,399
there the story will continue in a

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,559
moment how close is this to becoming a

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,559
regional conflict that could draw in US

21
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,199
troops we have absolutely no intention

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,680
nor do we have any plans to send

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,199
combat troops into Israel or Gaza period

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,320
vice president Harris told us the US is

25
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,799
not telling Israel what to do but is

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,960
providing advice equipment and

27
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,600
diplomatic support a terrorist

28
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,720
organization Hamas

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,520
slaughtered hundreds of young people at

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,040
a concert by most estimates at least,

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,600
1400 Israelis are dead Israel without

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,159
any question has a right to defend

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,280
itself that being said it is very

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,920
important that there be no conflation

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,960
between Hamas and the Palestinians the

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,520
Palestinians

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,280
deserve equal measures of Safety and

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,600
Security self-determination and dignity

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,479
and we have been very clear that the

40
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,759
rules of war must be adhered to and that

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,439
there be human humanitarian Aid that

42
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,439
flows she told told us the US wants to

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,759
keep the conflict from escalating but

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,280
that's proving difficult in the last two

45
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,640
weeks Hezbollah in lebanan and the

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,760
houthis in Yemen both proxies of Iran

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,640
have launched missiles rockets and

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,760
drones against Israel and Iranian backed

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,239
militias have fired on US troops

50
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,920
stationed in Iraq and Syria in response

51
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,920
the US launched air strikes against

52
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,280
Iranian weapons facilities in Syria if

53
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,200
that weren't enough of a signal to Iran

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,680
and other adversaries the Pentagon has

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,319
also deployed two imposing aircraft

56
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,120
carrier strike groups to the region and

57
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,440
what's the message to Iran

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,760
don't as President Biden said just don't

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,879
exactly one word pretty

60
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,120
straightforward since the Hamas attack

61
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,000
on Israel the Vice President says she

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,319
has spoken with President Isaac Herzog

63
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,040
of Israel and joined President Biden on

64
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
calls with prime minister Benjamin

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,720
president Mahmud abas President Joe

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,400
Biden told us in a statement this is as

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
high stakes and complex a situation as

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,080
it gets and kamla is my partner in all

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,319
of it he told us Harris's advice and

71
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,120
counsel are

72
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,680
invaluable when he was vice president Mr

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,720
Biden famously said that he wanted to be

74
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,799
the last person in the room with

75
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,000
President Obama do you have that

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,760
relationship with President Biden I do

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,000
you do I do and um and I take that

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,879
responsibility quite seriously how often

79
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,040
do you meet with him multiple times a

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,159
day quite often unless he or I are

81
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:47,879
traveling they're in total agreement the

82
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,959
US must stand with Israel and Ukraine

83
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,799
two democracies under attack we

84
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,000
are as

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,400
committed to Ukraine as we've always

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,879
been to

87
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,599
authorize additional Aid to defend

88
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,120
itself against Russia's unprovoked

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,519
aggression that is not going to waver

90
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,000
does this war in the Middle East put

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,720
Ukraine on a back burner not for us no

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,319
it does not put us put them on a back

93
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,840
burner at

94
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,280
all vice president Harris has visited 19

95
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,840
countries and met with more than 100

96
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
world

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,360
leaders but lately she has been the

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,280
administration's Point person on

issues before the 2024 election issues

102
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,160
she hopes will fire up the base but are

103
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,720
bound to inflame the

104
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,880
GOP she went to North Carolina to Mark

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919

attack our fundamental

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
rights how dare they attack our freedom

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,800
in Virginia it was Guns our nation is

110
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
being torn apart by gun

111
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,320
violence we joined the vice president

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,199
and second gentleman Doug mhof on Air

joined a secure video call with the

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,400
president and their national security

Homeland safe

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,479
once on the ground in Las

122
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,240
Vegas vice president Harris went to the

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,520
College of Southern Nevada the eighth

124
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,479
stop on her fight for our freedoms

125
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,479
College Tour because you voted Joe Biden

126
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,840
is president of the United States and I

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,080
am Vice President of the United States

128
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,479
because you voted but nationally the

129
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,720
Biden Harris Administration is not

130
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,319
generating the kind of enthusiasm she's

131
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,520
seeing on her tour a recent CBS poll

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,160
found that at the beginning of President

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,360
Biden's term 70% of young people people

134
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
under 30 said he was doing a good job

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
now it's less than

136
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,800
50% why is that what's going on if you

137
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,080
pull how young people feel about the

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,800
climate and the warming of our planet it

139
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,039
pulls as one of their top concerns when

140
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,720
we talk about what we are doing with

141
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,520
student loan debt polls very high the

142
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
challenge that we have as an

143
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,199
Administration is we got to let people

144
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,960
know who BR it to them that's our

145
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,720
challenge but it is not that the work we

146
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,199
are doing is not very very popular with

147
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,599
a lot of people she blames the

148
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:46,000
disconnect in part on lack of media

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,319
coverage still the vice president

150
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,360
herself is not very popular now just 41%

151
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,240
of adults told CBS news they approve of

152
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,840
the job she's doing about the same for

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,759
President Biden we talked to her the day

154
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,400
before the Carnage in Maine but she had

155
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,080
told us issues like mass shootings are

156
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
more important than poll numbers you

157
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,960
have a portfolio that includes gun

158
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
violence the root cause of migration

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,400
these are some of the most intractable

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,039
issues facing the country we've done

161
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,160
some of the most significant gun safety

162
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,800
laws in 30 years but we still need an

163
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,319
assault weapons ban it doesn't have to

164
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,199
be this way there was an assault weapons

165
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,319
ban at one time it expired let's renew

166
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,720
it most Americans say that they don't

167
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,440
think you're doing a good job on the

168
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
border you and the administration the

169
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,960
number of people trying to cross the US

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,199
Southern border is at an all-time high

171
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,879
it's no secret that we have a broken

172
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,960
immigration system shortterm we need a

173
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,280
safe orderly and Humane border policy

174
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,400
and long-term we need to invest in the

175
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,919
root causes of migration but the bottom

176
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,000
line Congress needs to act come on

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,960
participate in the solution instead of

178
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,039
political gamesmanship if politics is a

179
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,759
game kamla Harris has proven herself to

180
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,919
be a Savvy player forging a career that

181
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,560
has gone from one first to another the

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,680
to be elected vice president of the

190
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,080
United States being in that unique

191
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,360
position being that first yeah does that

192
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,720
bring added pressure no doubt no doubt

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,800
you know my mother she would say KLA you

194
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
may be the first to do many things make

195
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,800
sure you're not the

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,240
last and among the

197
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,839
responsibilities that I carry and maybe

198
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:05,800
impose on myself that is one of them so

199
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,079
this was she showed us around the vice

200
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,519
president's ceremonial office I brought

201
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,320
in this bust of th Good Marshall uh and

202
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,200
I always have him over my right shoulder

203
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,440
in the drawer here the desk where

204
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,399
previous vice presidents left their

205
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,440
signatures alore Quail Cheney Harry

206
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,959
Truman some of these men went on to

207
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,640
become president but kamla Harris told

208
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,160
us she is focused on getting the Biden

209
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,320
Harris ticket reelected next year the

210
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
GOP is using her low poll numbers and

211
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,720
President Biden's age as a battering ram

212
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
and some Democrats are growing worried

213
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,800
we were talking to some democratic

214
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,120
donors and they have told us that should

215
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,760
something befall President Biden and he

216
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,120
is not able to run that there would be a

217
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,880
freefor all for who would run as

218
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,120
president you are in the spot that that

219
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,040
would be a natural for you to step up

220
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,240
but we're hearing from donors that they

221
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,000
would not naturally fall into line why

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
is that well first of all I'm not going

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
to engage in that hypothetical because

224
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,399
Joe Biden is very much alive and running

225
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
for re-election so you do know I mean

226
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
that is a concern and and a legitimate

227
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,480
concern I would say I hear from a lot of

228
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,880
different people a lot of different

229
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
things but let me just tell you I'm

230
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,959
focused on the job I truly am our

231
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,480
democracy is on the line bill and I

232
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,240
frankly in my head do not have time for

233
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,720
parlor games when we have a president

234
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,760
who is running for

235
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,040
reelection that's it Joe Biden

236
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,079
conventional wisdom is that most

237
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,440
presidential elections are won or lost

238
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,399
on the economy and while inflation has

239
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,279
been coming down prices for Basics like

240
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,160
food and shelter remain staggeringly

241
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,600
high we came into office during the

242
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,320
height of a pandemic record

243
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,279
unemployment and because of our economic

244
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,959
policies we now are reducing inflation

245
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,880
we have created over 14 million new jobs

246
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,680
we've created over 800,000 new

247
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,519
manufacturing jobs wages are up and so

248
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,480
we've seen great progress considering

249
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,040
what you are laying out as your

250
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,800
achievements you have the current front

251
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,519
runner for the GOP Donald Trump facing

252
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,440
what 91 criminal charges I've lost count

253
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,000
yet the Biden Harris ticket is running

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,079
neck and neck with Donald Trump why are

255
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,240
you not 30 points ahead well I'm not I'm

256
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,680
not a political pundit so I I I'm not

257
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
going to speak to that but what I will

258
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
say is this when the American people are

259
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
able to take a close look at election

260
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,160
time on their options I think the choice

261
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,600
is going to be clear Bill we're going to

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,440
win let me just tell you that we're

263
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,399
going to

264
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,279
win and I'm not saying it's going to be

265
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,240
easy but we will win you say that with

266
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,839
such conviction I have no doubt but I

267
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,240
also have no doubt it's going to be a

268
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
lot of work and everyone's going to have

269
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,720
to participate this is a

270
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,880
democracy democracy she said that word

271
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,480
often during our interview despite the

272
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,240
criticism and low poll numbers former

273
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,120
prosecutor kamla Harris told us she's

274
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,440
prepared to trust the verdict of the

275
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,320
American people do you have to ask

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,079
yourself why are people seeming not to

277
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,440
hear our message I look at it more as

278
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,519
let's keep getting out there and as with

279
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,880
any election we got to make our case to

280
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,839
the American people that's part of our

281
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
responsibility and that's this process

282
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,880
and that's what it is and that's a fair

283
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
process
