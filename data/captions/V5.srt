1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,080
not since Watergate has an attorney

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,000
general been at the center of such a

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,440
firestorm Merrick Garland's justice

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,799
department is Prosecuting both former

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,039
president Trump and the son of President

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,240
Biden caught in the middle is this

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,760
70-year-old former prosecutor and

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
well-respected judge with a long history

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,519
as a moderate we met Garland Friday in

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,400
Washington he told us that he devoted

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,200
his life to the rule of law because of

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
his family's struggle to escape the

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,719
Holocaust now he's responsible for

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,879
prosecutions that will shape the future

15
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,960
of the nation in a rare interview the

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
Attorney General told us that in the

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,120
Trump and Biden trials ahead his

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,320
prosecutors will pursue Justice without

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
fear and without

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,920
favor the story will continue in a

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
moment

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,120
we do not have one rule for republicans

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,439
and another rule for Democrats we don't

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,920
have one rule for foes and another for

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,119
friends we don't have one rule for the

26
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,280
powerful another for the powerless for

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,080
the rich or for the poor based on

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,759
ethnicity we have only one rule and that

29
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,799
one rule is that we follow the facts and

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,880
the law and we reach the decisions

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,680
required by the Constitution and we

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,640
protect civil liberties are you

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,799
essentially saying as attorney general

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,520
to the American people trust me well in

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,600
the end I I suppose it does in the end

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,320
come down to trust but it's not just me

37
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,200
it's Decades of the of the Norms of this

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,479
department that are part of the DNA of

39
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,000
the career prosecutors who are running

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,640
the investigation um and supervising the

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,520
investigations that you're talking about

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,560
former president Trump faces two Federal

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,200
trials one for allegedly hoarding

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,039
classified documents and covering it up

45
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,439
the other for allegedly conspiring to

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,000
see power after the 2020 election

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
attorney general Garland has said little

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,759
about this and we wanted to understand

49
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,039
why well I think the first thing to

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,720
understand is because these are pending

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
cases because there are two federal

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,400
indictments the long-standing rule in

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,040
the Justice Department is that we can't

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,160
comment about pending cases where does

55
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,400
that rule come from what's the point one

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,800
reason is to protect the privacy and

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,360
civil liberties of the person who's

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,840
under investigation it's to protect

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,920
Witnesses who also may or may not become

60
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,360
public later in an investigation and

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
then finally it's to protect the

62
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,040
investigation itself um investigations

63
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,720
proceed in many different directions

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,519
eventually coming to a fruition a

65
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,040
decision to charge or not charge about a

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,840
particular thing or not and if Witnesses

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,200
and potential subjects knew everything

68
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
that the investigators had previously

69
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,840
looked at and we about to look at it

70
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,360
could well change testimony it could

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,480
well make make Witnesses unavailable to

72
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,040
us and this is not peculiar to the Trump

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,760
investigations well this is a rule for

74
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,840
all investigations this is part of what

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
we call our Justice manual it's been

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,440
there for probably at least 30 years and

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,280
probably longer than that help us

78
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
understand the

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,560
timing these prosecutions of the former

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,680
president are happening during the

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
campaign you could make the argument

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,720
that it's the worst possible

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,400
time the justice department has general

84
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
practice IES about not making

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,640
significant overt steps or charging

86
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,439
within a month or so of an election we

87
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,120
are clearly outside that uh that time

88
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,640
frame uh in these cases um prosecutors

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,879
special counsel they follow the facts in

90
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,280
the law where they lead when they've

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,239
gotten the amount of evidence necessary

92
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,040
to make a charging decision and have

93
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,920
decided that a charge is warranted

94
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,120
that's when they bring their cases the

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,879
investig ation itself has determined the

96
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,560
timing yes exactly right your critics

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
say that it's time to ruin Mr Trump's

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
chances in the election well that's

99
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,799
absolutely not true justice department

100
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,640
prosecutors are nonpartisan they don't

101
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,720
allow partisan considerations to play

102
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,959
any role in their determinations the

103
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,680
prosecutor in the Trump cases is Jack

104
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,759
Smith he was named by Garland to be

105
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,759
special counsel that's a job under the

106
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,360
regulations of the justice department

107
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
designed to give Smith broad

108
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,919
independence from the department and

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,639
from the White House the most important

110
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,479
aspect of the regulations is that the

111
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,840
special councel is not subject to the

112
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,360
day-to-day supervision of anyone in the

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,440
Justice Department you are not in

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
communication with the president or any

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,800
member of his administration with regard

116
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,680
to the investigation of former president

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Trump no I am not if President Biden

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,960
asked you you to take action with regard

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,440
to the Trump investigation what would

120
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,919
your reaction be I am sure that that

121
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,080
will not happen um but I would not uh do

122
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,560
anything um in that regard um and if

123
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,720
necessary I would resign but I there is

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,680
no sense that anything like that will

125
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,280
happen have you ever had to tell him

126
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
hands off these investigations Mr

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,639
President no because he has never tried

128
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,400
to put hands on these investigations

129
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,440
separately president President Biden

130
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,880
himself is the subject of a special

131
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,680
councel investigation into whether he

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,639
improperly held classified documents

133
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
after he was vice president his son

134
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
Hunter Biden is the target of a 4year

135
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,319
investigation into his business deals

136
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,240
and his taxes he's been indicted for

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,400
lying about drug abuse when he bought a

138
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
gun Republicans accus special counsel

139
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,520
David Weiss of slow walking the hunter

140
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
Biden investigation the allegation is Mr

141
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,639
attorney

142
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
general that what is described in some

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,360
quarters as the Biden justice

144
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
department is taking it easy on the

145
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,240
president's son well look um this

146
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,639
investigation began under David Weiss uh

147
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,240
David Weiss is a long-standing career

148
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,840
prosecutor and he was appointed by Mr

149
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,759
Trump as the United State's Attorney uh

150
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,880
for the District of Delaware I promised

151
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,120
at my nomination hearing that I would

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,880
continue him on in that position uh and

153
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,639
that I would not interfere with this

154
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,199
investigation you are not participating

155
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,840
in those decisions no Mr Weiss is making

156
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,759
those decisions the White House is not

157
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:48,759
attempting to influence those decisions

158
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,759
absolutely not and he said we won't have

159
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,720
to take his word for it under justice

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,960
department regulations a special counsel

161
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,080
must write a final report which I will

162
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,360
make public to the extent um permissible

163
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,599
under the law um that is required to

164
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,080
explain their prosecutive decisions

165
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,919
their decisions to prosecute or not

166
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,240
prosecute and their strategic decisions

167
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
along the way usually the special

168
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
councils have testified at the end of

169
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
their reports and I expect that that

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
will be the case here how's your

171
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,280
relationship with the president it must

172
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,319
be

173
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,400
Frosty I have a good working

174
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,919
relationship with the president good

175
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,319
perhaps but maybe not close the

176
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,160
president addressed the question in

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,520
August when he spotted Garland at a

178
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,599

00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,080
among Garland's gravest

191
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,520
concerns people can argue with each

192
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,520
other as much as they want and as

193
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,000
vociferously as they want but the one

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,440
thing they may not do is use violence

195
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,199
and threats of violence to alter the

196
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,639
outcome and an important aspect of this

197
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,800
is the American people themselves the

198
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,159
American people must protect each

199
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,919
other they must

200
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,000
ensure that they treat each

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,600
other with Civility and kindness listen

202
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,880
to opposing views argue as vifer usly as

203
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,360
they want but refrain from violence and

204
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,959
threats of violence that's the only way

205
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,200
this democracy Will Survive why do you

206
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
feel so strongly about

207
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,519
that well I feel it for a number of

208
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,720
reasons and number of things that I've

209
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,360
seen but for my own family who who uh

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,959
fled uh religious persecution in Europe

211
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:13,839
um and some members who did not

212
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,920
uh survive when they got to the United

213
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,920
States the United States

214
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,720
protect it guaranteed uh that they could

215
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,880
practice their religion they could vote

216
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,120
they could do all the things they

217
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,399
thought a democracy would provide um

218
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
that's the difference between this

219
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
country and many other countries and

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
it's my responsibility it's the Justice

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,200
Department's responsibility to ensure

222
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
that that difference continues that we

223
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
protect each

224
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,440
other two of your ancestors were

225
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,240
murdered in the

226
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,320
Holocaust yes is that why you devoted

227
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,760
yourself to the

228
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,880
law yes uh that's I would say that's why

229
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,800
I devoted myself to the rule of law uh

230
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
to Public Service uh to try and to

231
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,760
ensure that the rule of law um um

232
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,519
governs this country and continues to

233
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,079
govern this country Merrick Garland has

234
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,880
spent a life in the law m e r r i c k g

the Oklahoma City bombing case at Act of

238
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,200
political terrorism later after nearly

239
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,480
two decades as a federal appeals court

240
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,200
judge he was nominated to the US Supreme

241
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,480
Court by President Obama but Republicans

242
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,320
stalled the nomination for 10 months

243
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
until Donald Trump was sworn in

244
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,639
president-elect Biden picked Garland for

245
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,680
Attorney

246
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,480
General on the same day the capital was

247
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,560
attacked that became one of the largest

248
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,560
investigations in the Department's

249
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,200
history we've U arrested and brought

250
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,720
charges against more than 1,00 uh people

251
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
um there are uh more to come um the

252
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,519
videos that uh every single person uh

253
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
happen to have on their phones uh that

254
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,440
security cameras had that bystanders had

255
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,760
that the media had at the time uh

256
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
disclosed faces some of which we have

257
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,839
not yet been able to connect uh to

258
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,880
people you're looking for new suspects

259
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,320
new defendants still yeah there it's not

260
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,120
that they're new suspects but there they

261
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,040
are people that we haven't found yet why

262
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,560
do these prosecutions mean so much to

263
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,279
you because this is a fundamental aspect

264
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,360
of our democracy if we can't ensure that

265
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,880
this kind of behavior doesn't recur it

266
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,920
will occur the prosecutions we bring are

267
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,959
deterrence against that from happening

268
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,120
Garland knows he will be vilified no

269
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,440
matter how the Trump and Biden cases are

270
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,680
decided his job he told us was to take

271
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,760
the arrows for the Department he has

272
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,920
learned to embrace the pain that comes

273
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,200
with the job the youngest right now is

274
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,040
Riot Mitchell Forever 8 months old and

275
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,399
we saw that at DEA headquarters where he

276
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,160
was surrounded by those lost to the

277
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,800
opioid epidemic is the attorney general

278
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,839
and their grieving families meeting them

279
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,360
he told us reminds him of why he fights

280
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,279
and whom he is fighting for thank you

281
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,199
for being here and listening to us I

282
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,600
represent the American people um I don't

283
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,440
represent the president I represent the

284
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,040
American people and likewise I am not

285
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,079
congress's prosecutor I work for the

286
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,120
American

287
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,079
people and if democracy is an emotional

288
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,800
subject for Merrick Garland maybe it's

289
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,720
because he has witnessed how suddenly it

290
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
can be threatened in Oklahoma City and

291
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,839
Washington

292
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,240
DC when the history of this

293
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,839
extraordinary time is written what is

294
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,000
the best that Merrick Garland can hope

295
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,519
for look I think it's the best any

296
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,720
public servant can hope for that we've

297
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,680
done our best that we pass on a justice

298
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,680
department that uh continues to pursue

299
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,160
the rule of law and protect it uh and

300
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,720
it's it's the same thing that every

301
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
generation has to Hope um that we can

302
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,959
pass our democracy on in working order

303
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,760
um to the next uh generation that picks

304
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,920
up the torch and is responsible when

305
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,800
we're finished uh to continue that

306
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
job
