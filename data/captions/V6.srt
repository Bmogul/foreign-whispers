1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,899
conventionally 60 Minutes doesn't

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,360
profile the same subject twice in two

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,120
seasons but convention doesn't intersect

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,099
with Pro Football Hall of Famer Dion

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,859
Sanders last fall we met Sanders in

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,480
Mississippi where he was coaching

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,520
Jackson State to prominence in a

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,199
conference of historically black

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,140
colleges and universities then the man

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,539
who calls himself coach prime high

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,220
stepped it to Boulder to the University

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,099
of Colorado taking his blazingly

13
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,040
singular Style with him there he hasn't

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
just awoken a dormant program but has

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,600
transformed it into the talk of college

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,020
football if not American Sports Sanders

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,079
is revered he is reviled but a Sudden

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,719
Impact is indisputable for the second

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,700
time in two radically different

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,700
environments Unapologetic as ever he's

21
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,120
shaken the sport like a snow globe

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,460
the story will continue in a moment

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,379
are you the change agent are you the

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,700
ultimate change agent I make a

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,520
difference I truly make a difference I

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,400
make folks nervous man I give folks

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,080
moving in their seat I get folks

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,820
twirling their thumbs I get them

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,619
thinking and second guessing they said

30
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,360
you know have you ever been so clean

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,640
that you walked in and somebody looked

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,900
down at you then they looked at

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,280
themselves they had to check themselves

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,619
because you were so clean I have that

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,960
effect that's the vibe you're getting I

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,040
have that effect

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,420
that was some good game right there but

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,439
God that was good we ain't got next

39
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:44,910
we got now

40
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,720
[Music]

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,200
[Applause]

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,579
this was the scene in the locker room

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,500
two weekends ago

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,700
[Applause]

45
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,560
before the Colorado Buffaloes and their

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
new coach Dion Sanders opened the season

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,719
to 21 Point Underdog at PCU good job

48
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,560
Colorado was fresh off a 1 in 11 season

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,180
TCU was fresh from playing in last

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,300
season's national championship game

51
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,840
with skill and will the Buffaloes won

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,700
45-42 behind their Star Quarterback

53
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,520
shudor Sanders but the real Focus as

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,280
ever was on shidur's 56 year old father

55
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,980
it was his first win as coach of a power

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,319
five School the highest level of college

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,940
football do you feel like you were

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,040
underestimated if you come here and it's

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,200
I don't know if coach Prime can win you

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,459
must have heard what some of these other

61
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,319
coaches were saying both secretly

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,060

63
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,959

did that

72
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,480
his Colorado debut Drew national

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,440
attention and monster TV ratings

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,599
interest compounded last weekend when

75
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,099
the Buffaloes played before the biggest

76
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,860
home crowd in 15 years in beat rival

77
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,580
Nebraska

78
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,159
this weekend both Fox and ESPN

79
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,319
dispatched their pregame shows the rock

80
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,780
included to Boulder then the Buffaloes

81
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,060
rallied late to beat Colorado State in a

82
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,239
double overtime Thriller

83
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,280
three games into the season the

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,019
foothills of the Rockies marked the

85
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,720
unlikely epicenter of an entire sport

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,180
what's this been like for you

87
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,760
um it's it's been a lot of fun

88
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,340
Rick George who hired coach Prime has

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,560
been Colorado's athletic director for a

90
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,920
decade it's great for us to be able to

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,860
bring this program back to relevancy and

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,159
we had failed in my previous nine years

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,959
10 years fair to call this bit of a Hail

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,599
Mary it wasn't a Hail Mary but it was a

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
moment in time for our University and

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,519
our athletic department that we were

97
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:03,959
either going to be relevant or we were

98
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:05,640
going to be irrelevant

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,040
it's too early to quantify the full

100
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,420
Prime effect but merchandise sales up

101
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,599
819 from last season Instagram followers

102
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,320
up more than tenfold season tickets sold

103
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
out

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,440
Sanders might be the ideal coach for

105
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,380
these shifting times in college football

106
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,840
another son Dion JR is part of the army

107
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,759
of videographers filming the team

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,639
non-stop for YouTube and an upcoming

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,080
docu-series

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,020
steam won one game last season is that

111
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,560
in a way a point of appeal God wouldn't

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
relocate me to something that was

113
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,940
successful that don't make sense to it

114
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,360
he had to find the most

115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,660
disappointing in the most uh difficult

116
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,100
task

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,780
in this

118
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,120
is what it was and this is what it is

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,100
and I love that

120
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,259
this wasn't dissimilar to what he told

121
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,840
us last year that God had called him

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
collect to come to Jackson State

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
University and Elevate yes the football

124
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
program but also all hbcus

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,979
he stayed three seasons but the same

126
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:16,500
night last December that JSU won the

127
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,360
conference Championship Sanders

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,639
announced he was off to Colorado to

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,680
climb Another Mountain you left Jackson

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,680
State and you left quickness

131
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,419
leave quick I left what I was supposed

132
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,860
to leave

133
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,380
to leave most coaches get a new job and

134
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,720
they leave expeditiously I finished the

135
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,580
task you say finish the task was there

136
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,600
was there more work you could have done

137
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,340
in Jackson or I think we did a

138
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,500
tremendous job in Jackson I think we

139
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,380
laid down the tremendous blueprint

140
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,419
we tried to press Sanders on the

141
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,639
circumstances surrounding his abandoning

142
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,220
the mission at Jackson State he's hinted

143
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,080
the school's lack of Forward Thinking

144
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,780
may have factored in his decision but on

145
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,180
this topic he was about as elusive as he

146
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,160
was returning punts for touchdowns in

147
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,900
the NFL what'd you tell his kids when

148
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,460
you left

149
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,960
um opportunity

150
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,380
called sooner and later in life there

151
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,120
will be opportunity that knocks at your

152
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,460
door and at this juncture in my life I

153
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,139
felt like the opportunity for not only

154
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,180
me but for my kids as well was

155
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,000
tremendous not only did we take several

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,759
kids from that team

157
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,560
three trainers

158
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,580
maybe 12 to 14 staffers so we afforded

159
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,460
to give people a tremendous opportunity

160
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,539
here

161
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,819
the distance between Jackson and Boulder

162
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,580
is a thousand miles and immeasurably

163
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,460
further culturally Sanders went from a

164
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,919
city that is 83 percent black to one

165
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,440
that is one percent black from a place

166
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,600
with a Water Crisis to the kind of

167
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,699
hipster college town where there's a

168
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,400
shop devoted to kites what are your

169
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,699
first impressions uh beautiful

170
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,220
unbelievable just the whole peace and

171
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,860
serenity of it all I never fathom coming

172
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,479
here I ain't never even vacation here

173
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,460
man I ain't never been skiing or

174
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,740
whatever you call it snowboarding or

175
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,319
whatever all the stuff you know ain't

176
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,520
never done none of that you don't even

177
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,280
fly fish no I don't I fish

178
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,180
I'm fly why I fish but I don't fly fish

179
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,099
still he wasted no time ingratiating

180
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,560
himself in the community including a

181
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,319
visit to Peggy coppam a 98 year old

182
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:32,880
Buffalo Super Fan

183
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,300
how about good looking this

184
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,520
he was less embracing of the incumbent

185
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,800
Colorado players at the first team

186
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
meeting in December Sanders encouraged

187
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,419
players to enter the transfer portal an

188
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,400
open market for athletes to find new

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,099
schools I promise you it's my job to get

190
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,199
rid of them and make room for Superior

191
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,199
Talent he planned to bring in more than

192
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,660
50 players eventually transferred out

193
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,699
you got here and you didn't pull punches

194
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,639
you told some of these guys have I ever

195
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,520
you take a team that's won one game and

196
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,860
you fired a whole coaching staff so who

197
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,960
did the coaching staff recruit

198
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,460
the kids

199
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,699
so the kids are just

200
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,919
as much to blame as the coaching staff

201
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,800
and I came to the conclusion that a

202
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,080
multitude of them can help us get to

203
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,940
where we wanted to go you told most of

204
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,500
these guys the more you jump in the more

205
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
room you're going to make those of you

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,379
we don't run off we're going to try to

207
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,900
make you quit yeah you made it very

208
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,680
clear yeah now if you went for that if

209
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,260
you were able to let words run you off

210
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,360
you ain't for us because we're old

211
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,640
school staff we coach hard we coach tuck

212
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,060
we're disciplined narrants so if you're

213
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,120
allowing verbiage to run you off because

214
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,680
you don't feel secure with your ability

215
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,660
you ain't for us

216
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,880
if some kid said you know what no I'm

217
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,320
staying you're not going to run me off

218
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,899
with your words right stay so prove it

219
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,660
I'm sure that your straight talk was

220
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,459
appreciated by some but is this scorched

221
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,959
Earth policy good for for college

222
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,480
football or for the kids I think truth

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,120
is good for kids we're so busy lying we

224
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,860
don't even recognize the truth no more

225
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,440
in society we want everybody to feel

226
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,779
good that's not that's not the way life

227
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,080
is now it is my job to make sure I have

228
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,180
what we need to win

229
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,399
that makes a lot of people feel good

230
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,260
winning does I got to push back on this

231
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,620
you're a father of college athletes yes

232
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,240
if they called you and say hey we got a

233
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,380
new coach and they're telling me to get

234
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,060
in the transfer portal I say son you

235
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,580
must be you must not be doing well

236
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,200
that's what you said you must not be

237
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,300
doing well because you should be an

238
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,000
asset and not a liability I'm honest

239
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
with my kids his kids include shador the

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,399
star quarterback in Shiloh of starting

241
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,920
safety if you guys have any idea that

242
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
you are going to be this good and

243
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,500
capture the country the way you have

244
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,100
yeah you did yeah we both didn't come

245
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,820
here

246
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,420
have our dad closing just to lose

247
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,640
a year ago to the day we watched the

248
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,160
door fleeing and Zing touchdown passes

249
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,680
at Jackson State

250
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
but there were questions about whether

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
he could do the same against stiffer

252
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,860
competition well in his first two games

253
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,980
at Colorado he threw for nearly 1 000

254
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,980
yards without an interception

255
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,899
you were putting up big numbers at

256
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:24,300
Jackson State you're doing it here

257
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,180
against teams and the Big Ten yeah the

258
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,880
big 12. must be gratifying yeah now

259
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,440
these two games was the most yards I

260
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,000
passed for in my career

261
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,040
so it's just it's just exciting knowing

262
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
that you know to translate and like on a

263
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,899
bigger stage I just feel better he's

264
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,700
also and again welcome to today's

265
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,220
college sports translated his success

266
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,279
into riches thanks to nil name image

267
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
likeness income so much so he drives a

268
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,019
one hundred and ninety thousand dollar

269
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,959
Mercedes Maybach and chidur might not

270
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,180
even be the team's best player Travis

271
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,279
Hunter also followed coach Prime from

272
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,860
Jackson to Colorado his coach lets him

273
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,140
play offense and defense virtually

274
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,360
unheard of in the modern college game

275
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,880
you've got two really good Heisman

276
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,339
quality players on this team yes your

277
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,440
son and Travis Hunter yes sir first half

278
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
of the first game of the season you're

279
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,519
already publicly talking about Travis

280
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,100
Hunter's Heisman chances who does that a

281
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,620
a coach that loves his kids the coach

282
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,620
that understands that's what those kids

283
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,800
desire and I supposed to do that that's

284
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,360
what we told them when they were coming

285
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,079
and choosing to play for us my kids that

286
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
play for me they didn't choose a

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
university

288
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,620
they chose me that's the difference

289
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,420
coaches have chosen to join Sanders as

290
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,060
well the staff he overhauled and

291
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,779
upgraded includes former head coaches

292
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:50,579
and former coordinators from schools

293
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,560
like Alabama now that you're a power

294
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,320
Five Guy mm-hmm who's the best coach in

295
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,079
college football today

296
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,540
let me see let me see a mirror so I can

297
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,240
look at it

298
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,820
you feel that

299
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,959
you think I'm gonna sit up here and tell

300
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,640
you somebody else

301
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,440
you think you think that's the way I

302
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,240
operate that somebody else got that on

303
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,519
me but I tell you this

304
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,620
I love and I adore and I respect and

305
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,380
every time I do a commercial with Coach

306
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,220
Saban it's a gift just sitting in his

307
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,740
presence and hearing him and and

308
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,360
throwing something else out there so I

309
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,980
could hear his viewpoint on it because

310
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,279
he's forgotten more things than I may

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,600
ever accomplish so I'm a student looking

312
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
up to this wonderful teacher saying

313
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
just just throw me a crumb of what you

314
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,380
know

315
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,779
for all the bling and Bluster there is

316
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,420
some humility and the current Mania may

317
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,579
die down a bit as Colorado faces a

318
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:55,440
Welter of tougher opponents the rest of

319
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
the season

320
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,180
but Dion Sanders has invigorated the

321
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,720
campus a program an entire sport game

322
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,820
