1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,080
Rich Paul has become one of the Premier

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,559
agents in professional sports he counts

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,880
LeBron James as a close friend and

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,679
client the agency he founded clutch

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:17,000
Sports Group made deals worth almost

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
$900 million this past summer for his

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,480
NBA clients alone Paul honed his deal

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,039
making instincts as a kid navigating

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,119
what he called the Hostile streets of

10
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,400
his Cleveland neighborhood today at 42

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,280
he's rewriting the playbook for

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,360
representing pro athletes Rich Paul told

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,040
us he was lucky and when you hear his

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,079
story we think you'll understand

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,160
why the story will continue in a

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,360
moment so did you used to come to games

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,680
when you were younger I went one time

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,760
when I had to um sit all the way up at

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,280
the top you really couldn't couldn't see

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
the person and

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,079
now now it's now you're sitting on the

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,239
floor we joined Rich Paul courtside at a

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,119
Cleveland Cavaliers game last season he

24
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,960
seemed to know

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,799
everyone what up do what's good and it

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,240
seemed everyone wanted to know

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,079
him thank you so much you're my ID bro

28
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,159
thank you brother I appreciate it last

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,680
year Paul got Cleveland star Darius

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,400
Garland a $200 million deal the richest

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,320
in franchise history Garland is one of

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,720
nearly 200 athletes on Paul's roster who

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,880
are some of the big names that we would

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,119
all recognize which sport you want I

35
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,079
mean we just had Jaylen herzon and

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
Devonte Smith playing the Super Bowl for

37
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
the Philadelphia Eagles and then you got

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,000
the Anthony Davis's and uh Draymond

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,840
greens and obviously LeBron do you know

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,520
the total value of the contracts you've

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,920
negotiated I would say it's close to 3

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,680
billion I think it's more than 4 billion

43
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,600
but it's hard to keep track when you're

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
always on the go showtime baby before

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,119
the NBA draft in New York City we

46
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,039
watched him work the phones you know

47
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,280
it's draft day man anything can happen

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,120
work the room hey coach how you doing

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,879
man right and work the angles to move

50
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,920
clients like Duke Center Derek Lively II

51
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,120
up the draft board you ready sir in

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,280
college Lively was known for his defense

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,720
but Paul had him work on his three-point

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,840
shot and before the draft invited teams

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,959
to see Lively shot up to the 12th pick

56
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,959
about 10 spots higher than first

57
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,599
projected it might not look like it but

58
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,920
Rich Paul is a towering figure in the

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
NBA I've always been the smallest guy in

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
the

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,879
room willing to take the biggest swing

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,000
some of his biggest swings have been for

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,200
his biggest client LeBron James Paul

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,800
negotiated his jumps from Miami to

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,599
Cleveland to LA a deals that netted

66
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,400
James $400 million and set him up to win

67
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,480
two of his four

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,879
championships he told us he works to

69
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,799
give players leverage some people say

70
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,319
that you're destroying the player

71
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,720
loyalty to the teams and the fans player

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,319
loyalty to what if I can be traded in

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,040
the middle of the night to another team

74
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,959
what I should be is educating myself to

75
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,959
where if this isn't going the way I

76
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:34,120
thought it was supposed to go I can

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,400
switch up right we're not I have options

78
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,599
I have op what's the sister to having

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,879
money with no

80
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,640
options that's apparently how Superstar

81
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,560
Anthony Davis felt in 2018 the New

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,120
Orleans Center had a $127 million

83
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,200
contract but was tired of losing so he

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,959
fired his agent and hired Rich Paul Paul

85
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,120
flouted NBA rules by publicly demanding

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,480
a trade earning the wrath of fans and a

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,239
$50,000 fine for Davis the drama landed

88
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,879
Paul on the cover of Sports Illustrated

89
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,159
which called him the most polarizing

90
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,000
figure in the

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
NBA when it was someone that didn't look

92
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,479
like me it was genius it was why you get

93
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,000
a power agent but when it's me I'm

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,520
destroying the league I mean those

95
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,199
things are absurd he got d us what he

96
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,639
wanted a championship ring and a deal

97
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,600
now worth $270

98
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,720
million there's a saying that goes if

99
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,960
you a got no haters you ain't

100
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
popping so you must be popping I think

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,840
I'm popping a little bit you know he was

102
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,759
popping a lot at his annual allstar game

103
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,320
party this past winter in Salt Lake City

104
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,600
is that we dropped in and saw giants of

105
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,120
the court mingling with rappers team

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,759
owners and Titans of Industry over

107
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,840
cocktails and canipes Rich Paul had a

108
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,680
full plate of business options one from

109
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
the president of Gatorade I want to be a

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,639
first call done while we were chatting

111
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,800
with

112
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,919
him Golden State Warrior Draymond Green

113
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,319
cut in the four-time NBA champion cycled

114
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,520
through two other agents before signing

115
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,759
up with Rich Paul who landed him a $100

116
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,800
million contract over the summer so then

117
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,600
you end up a young black man who's made

118
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,120
more money than you can ever imagine but

119
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,759
you don't know how to live with it you

120
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,600
don't know what to do with it and what

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,479
does he do most agents treat athletes as

122
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,280
if the athlete work for them but there's

123
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,720
a multi-billion Dollar

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,360
business going on around most athletes

125
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,960
that they don't understand but they

126
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,039
don't have a rich part to teach them and

127
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,199
that's what's special about it Paul's

128
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,360
improbable Journey the subject of his

129
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,080
new Memoir out this week started on the

130
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,479
east side of Cleveland in the early

131
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,440
1980s just as crack cocaine hit the

132
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,599
streets when he was about 4 he learned

133
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,560
his mother manura was hooked on crack

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,800
his father Big Rich recognized his son's

135
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,280
intelligence and kept him close though

136
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,560
they lived apart he owned the

137
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
neighborhood convenience store so your

138
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
dad's store was just right in here yeah

139
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,800
and this was this was my world this now

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,800
empty Corner was a hot bed of activity

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,599
legal and illegal it was a shootout

142
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,759
right here on this corner Big Rich

143
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,400
taught his son to always think two steps

144
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,919
ahead he scraped together the money to

145
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:41,199
send him to a Catholic High School away

146
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,000
from the neighborhood still there was no

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,639
avoiding the streets you don't know what

148
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,360
you're in that's your Norm that's my

149
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,280
Norm sardines out the can that was

150
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,479
today's version of tuna tartar on the

151
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,160
Waldorf

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,240
rooftop know this was my education

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,599
though this was this was my Harvard my

154
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,039
Michigan my morehous and the same things

155
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,000
I learned on this corner I take it to

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,960
the board room because the one thing

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
this teaches you that I don't think you

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,280
can learn from those institutions is

159
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,160
people

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,400
characters and on these streets it's no

161
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,280
better way to learn character because

162
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,599
they're coming with everything his dad

163
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,879
taught him another skill a way to make

164
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,080
money if all else fails with a Pair of

165
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,000
Dice Paul and his best friend Edward

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,400
given were regulars at an open air

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,520
Casino in the park 50 people crowded

168
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,120
around this little area and the energy

169
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,840
was high it was it was an arena and Rich

170
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,240
Paul was a natural and how much would

171
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,240
you earn I mean a slow day was $1,000

172
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,639
and a not slow day

173
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,800
H you know four or five $4 or 5,000 easy

174
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,560
when you were 14 15 16 oh yeah what did

175
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
you learn from this experience you gain

176
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
a resilience here we won majority of the

177
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,199
time but you also had to learn how to

178
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,879
lose he suffered his biggest loss when

179
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
he was 19 his father died from cancer

180
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
and Paul went all in on the streets

181
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
selling marijuana and crack cocaine this

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,319
is the very drug that your mother was

183
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,240
hooked on the absence of my

184
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,000
dad allowed me to to take that step

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,560
because I would have never done that had

186
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,320
he

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,839
been around I had too much respect for

188
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,360
him if it's not something that I would

189
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,560
sit here and and glorify it almost

190
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,399
sounds like you were a full-time Hustler

191
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,880
oh yeah but Jeff Bezos is a

192
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,279
hustler think he's not Phil Knight was

193
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,640
the ultimate Hustler the difference is

194
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,040
they could go with their plan and their

195
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,120
business

196
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,200
idea and get someone to believe in them

197
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,680
it didn't matter what idea I had there's

198
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,600
no Pathway to get there he found one

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,000
through a stroke of luck at the akan

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
Canton Airport in 2001 Paul was wearing

201
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,720
a throwback jersey like this one that

202
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,120
caught the eye of another traveler High

203
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,839
School hoop sensation LeBron James what

204
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,880
did you see in him it began with him you

205
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
know wearing a throwback jersey that I

206
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,000
you know loved but as we got to talk

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,760
about sports we started evolving and

208
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,320
even talking more and more just about

209
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,600
life and about our upbringing about our

210
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,720
our moms and and and our communities and

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,600
stuff of that nature and it um just kind

212
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,920
of struck it just struck a core when

213
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,920
James entered the NBA he hired Rich Paul

214
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,839
as a right-hand man Paul went on to work

215
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,000
for LeBron's agent and watched listened

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
and learned

217
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,079
I understand that you would go into

218
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:04,279
meetings with the likes of Warren

219
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,560
Buffett being in those

220
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,160
rooms is much better

221
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,000
to to listen than to talk if you listen

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,480
you might actually learn something and

223
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
you start to kind of you know work your

224
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,720
way on your own after just four years he

225
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,959
struck out on his own and launched

226
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,800
clutch Sports Group in 2012 LeBron James

227
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,640
went with him when you first started

228
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
this you were underestimated Not only

229
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,920
was I underestimated I was also not

230
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,399
wanted I didn't look like the success in

231
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,519
our industry especially from a place of

232
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,279
decision-making and I wanted to disrupt

233
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,440
the industry I wanted to be impactful

234
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,200
but I wanted to come from a place of

235
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,920
purpose in 2013 with his first

236
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,279
negotiation as agent for Phoenix Sons

237
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,279
guard Eric bledo he proved the naysayers

238
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,040
wrong he said the sons had offered $28

239
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,000
million and then $48 million and you

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,800
turned it down yeah but what was on the

241
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,760
line my

242
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,639
career everyone was calling and saying

243
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,519
he's crazy he don't know what he's doing

244
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
he's an experienced it sounds like you

245
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,000
are really comfortable rolling the dice

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
I was born a dice roller his gamble paid

247
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,880
off after hanging tough for a year

248
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,120
clutch got bled so a $70 million deal 42

249
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,160
million more than the son's first offer

250
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,920
great room today clutch has 70 employees

251
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,560
with offices in Los Angeles New York and

252
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,000
Atlanta and they both in the same draft

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,760
class Paul teamed up with Powerhouse

254
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,360
agency UTA to expand clutch's reach I

255
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,000
had to build a multi 100 million dollar

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,200
company to get people to believe in me

257
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,399
and there's still doubt critics say he's

258
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,360
only successful because of his

259
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,920
relationship with you I mean it's

260
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,440
disappointing to hear that would you

261
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,959
gave him an opportunity yeah and I don't

262
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,240
give people opportunities much um and he

263
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,320
took well Way Beyond um than what he

264
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
even imagined Rich Paul now has a new

265
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,959
balance signature shoe a first for an

266
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,560
