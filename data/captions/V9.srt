00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,800
have played through its identity crisis

00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,400
not the case for pool the Sport's very

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,160

like atick and chalk but that's as much

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,480
a curse as a blessing how can a sport

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,640
Thrive at the highest level when so much

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,519

aids and shuts down any question this

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,760
makes it harder for him to play

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,440
pool it's actually a big Advantage for

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,720
me how's that you know when I play po

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
tournament I can just shut it off do you

59
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,360
shut your hearing aids off when you play

60
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,480
when I want my first Uso and I had

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
everything off I was focused total

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,200
silence yes I'm totally like 100% zon in

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,080
never more zoned in than in 2018 when he

Shane Van boning and Team

71
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,400
USA unbelievable finish think you could

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,720
have made that

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,680
shot we went to Rapid City South Dakota

74
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,120
a side pocket of America to Van Bon's

75
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,159
pool hall where he explained that making

76
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,799
balls disappear into pockets is only

77
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,360
half of pool Excellence it's also about

78
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,319
setting up your neck shot

79
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,760
Q ball control they call it and I'm

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,360
going to make the Q ball stop right here

81
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,000
so I can shoot the two in the

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,319
side then I'm

83
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,040
going you did that how how did you do

84
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,720
that just hit it right below Center so

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,720
now it lines up that next ball perfectly

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
yeah I'm so struck by the geometry of

87
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,480
all this yeah I love geometry it's all

88
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,599
about the angles van boning says he can

89
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,720
see every angle on the table a six sense

90
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,560
that comes from practicing as much as 10

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,840
hours a day shooting half a million

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
balls a year I want to make the shot

93
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,360
perfect the only way to hit it perfect

94
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,239
you got to do it over and over and over

95
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:15,199
can you be perfect in this

96
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,079
sport

97
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,079
no I tried so hard so all these years

98
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,199
van boning comes by it honestly his

99
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,400
grandfather Gary Bloomberg a known

100
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,759
trickshot artist opened pool halls off

101
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,720
I90 easy access for Hustlers passing

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,080
across the Great Plains but these rooms

103
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,960
were familyfriendly places so much so

104
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,919
Shane got his first pool queue when he

105
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,400
was two and went to the pool room every

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,160
day after school not just to play but to

107
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,199
escape kids who picked on him for being

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,919
deaf how bad did it get the kid would

109
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,080
start throwing Ros at me they would put

110
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,840
gum in my hair and then I would go home

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
to my mom I'd be going home crying you

112
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,720
know and then she made me feel feel

113
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,199
better by asking me you want to go to

114
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,840
the pool room why did coming to the pool

115
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,639
room make you feel better you know when

116
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,600
you walk in the pool room what do you

117
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
see you know you see people having a

118
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,639
good time but it was more than that he

119
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,759
had prodigious ability for thinking

120
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,400
multiple Strokes ahead when van boning

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,120
was 18 he hit the road he and his uncle

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
loaded into an RV looking for money

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,440
games came to play pool fats of course

124
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,680
they did the Hustler that stealth

125
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,039
roadman armed only with a wooden stick

126
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,160
in confidence divorcing the locals from

127
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,639
their cash has been romanticized for

128
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,880
decades not least by Paul Newman this

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,360
reporter was so taken by po hustling he

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,560
once wrote a book about it for Van

131
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,720
boning the romance hit the Rocks

132
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,240
abruptly yeah I actually was playing the

133
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
pool in Tennessee and I was playing this

134
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,080
guy for money and we were playing for a

135
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,120
whole lot and he was

136
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
losing and he picked up the key ball and

137
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,639
threw it at me where'd he hit you he hit

138
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,000
me right on the chest it's the kind of

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
thing you do to start a fight yeah how'd

140
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,039
you react I told my Uncle I said I don't

141
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,759
want to do this anymore I don't want to

142
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,280
live on the road anymore it's just too

143
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,880
dangerous here we go for the title he

144
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
chose to go legit and began playing and

145
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,720
winning proper tournaments though less

146
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,639
lucrative than the rambling gambling

147
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,560
life van boning enjoyed being a

148
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,599
professional did you worry that coming

149
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:28,599
in off the road was going to impact your

150
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,520
your finances

151
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
I know some of the pool players like the

152
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,240
top pool players were making money so if

153
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,080
they can do it I can do it but pool is a

154
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,680
deceptively tricky sport next up two

155
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,240
superpowers Collide just ask Shane's

156
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,479
Scottish counterpart Jason Shaw another

157
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,120
top player earlier this year Shaw holed

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,520
up in a Virginia pool room for 5 days

159
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,360
and broke the straight pool record

160
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,800
making 74 shots in a row the stuff that

161
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,120
happens in pool will completely screw

162
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,720
your brain up what do you mean you'll

163
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,319
see shots that and you'll be like how

164
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,039
did that happen you'll you'll hear that

165
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,520
all day how did that land over there did

166
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
you see that how that went in in pool

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,280
you see at every game something weird

168
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
will happen does that make it more

169
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
exhilarating or more frustrating both

170
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
mentally you want to like flip the table

171
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,879
at some point you ever flipped a table

172
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,919
no I've thought about it a few times

173
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,080
people come in how hard could it be it's

174
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
just a rectangle with six and then 20

175
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,199
minutes later there's still 15 balls on

176
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,879
the table they've not poted a ball and

177
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,120
the guy's like scratching his head like

178
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,160
thought this was easy it's

179
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,879
not we watched you at Derby City play

180
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:42,080
Jason Shaw Jason who yeah is he rival

181
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,120
yeah it's been going on for several

182
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,080
years now he's a great player and um

183
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,159
we're always going to have a battle you

184
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,240
okay with that yeah you have to accept

185
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,639
losing if you don't accept losing you're

186
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,000
just you're going to go crazy I'll stick

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
is the ice right here if having a rival

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,919
is Central to being being an elite

189
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,000
athlete so is this leaving time to clear

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,879

191
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,120
following Shane Van boning out on to

192
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,120
Paola Lake in the Black

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Hills van boning goes fishing season be

194
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,080
damned every morning when he's back home

195
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,560
we didn't catch any fish we did catch

196
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,840
van bony's drift though his take on the

197
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,240
virtues of complete

198
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
silence vanity plate notwithstanding few

199
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,360
extravagances come with being number one

200
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
in pool the ragtag pro tour barely

201
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,800
televised in the US struggles to draw

202
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,479
much interest or investment outside of

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,320
pool die hards how many sponsors do you

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,839
have I have six sponsors cues and tables

205
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,560
and Pool Products yes and any sponsors

206
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
outside of pool no what can a top player

207
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,279
make top and pool can make only six

208
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,720
figures half expenses maybe five figures

209
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,519
no one's making a million bucks as a

210
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,240
pool player it never

211
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,839
happened van boning says cleaning up the

212
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
sport doing away with back room money

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,360
games would lure big corporate sponsors

214
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,880
big media deals and grow professional

215
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,519
pool we saw firsthand his discomfort

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,360
with gambling and all that comes with it

217
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,079
when we interviewed you in in dery city

218
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't if you remember the the

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,399
interview was interrupted you you recall

220
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,240
what

221
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,279
happened oh the

222
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,040
gambling was that what happened yeah

223
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,959
it was morning at Derby City and the

224
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,839
action upstairs from the night before

225
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,560
was still

226
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,519
simmering they

227
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,000
arguing over the course of a few minutes

228
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,959
two players who' bet on a game nearly

229
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,720
came to blows you cannot gamble you know

230
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,240
van boning could only shake his head it

231
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,880
got to be a clean sport Ender prop

232
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,360
pool's unlikely new Guardian Emily

233
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,160
Fraser of the British sports promoter

234
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,680
matchroom the company recently revamp

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
Pro darts and snooker in the UK

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,880
streamlining their circuits and turning

237
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,079
top players into celebrities who make

238
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,079
millions oh that's where the tra sits

239
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,040
Fraser is tasked with doing the same for

240
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,320
pool and she says gambling is the least

241
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,000
of her worries what's the state of

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,600
professional pool today ah an absolute

243
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,640
mess why' you say that the first ever US

244
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,160
Open that I did in

245
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,640
2019 oh my gosh the players turned up

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,240
they were in jeans when I'm going hang

247
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,959
on a second like what's happening here

248
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,920
why is this guy turning up in jeans

249
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,839
Fraser has asked Pro players to dress

250
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,760
the part but she won't ask them to give

251
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,920
up their side hustles now all of the

252
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,560
basement tables and the money matches I

253
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
think that's brilliant and that can

254
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
still yeah I think that it's fantastic

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
because it's got the history behind it

256
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,040
you're okay if people are still they're

257
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,160
gambling and playing money games as far

258
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,279
as I'm concerned in a couple years time

259
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,880
they won't need to have any money it'll

260
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,680
be obsolete the market will do its thing

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
exactly but right now now it's not

262
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,839
viewed as this professional sport and it

263
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,560
has all the ingredients to be one she

264
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
standardize the format this is

265
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
commercialized sponsor friendly nineball

266
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,839
not the solids and Stripes eight ball

267
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,440
you've likely played in October at the

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,360
US Open held in Atlantic City Fraser

269
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,560
brought in bigger live audiences and

270
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,160
ramped up TV production she's kept one

271
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
pool Hallmark the Smoke Filled Room

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,360
close but no cigar there's a machine

273
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,920
puffing away in the corner When the

274
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,600
Smoke cleared there was Shane Van

275
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,920
boning he was fresh off winning his

276
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,240
first world championship sealing his

277
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
status at top the sport he confided to

278
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
us that he'd slept with the trophy for a

279
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,680
month van boning is mobbed at pool

280
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
tournaments but can still walk through

281
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,720
an airport unbothered well he's no

282
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,120
LeBron James and I totally understand

283
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,279
that and I recognize that um it's our

284
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,639
job to turn that around it is our

285
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,399
responsibility to turn that world number

286
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,200
one prize money from

287
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,560
$80,000 to a million so it's prize money

288
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,000
it's more events and let's get these

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,160
players known you've got to fall in love

290
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,880
with them are they lovable yes some of

291
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,199
them the health of the sport also

292
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,160
depends on minting a new generation of

293
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,279
elite players so this tournament had a

294
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,880
junior division held alongside the pros

295
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,760
and named what else the Shane Van boning

296
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,920
Jr open these are future Pros oh yeah

297
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,360
definitely definitely they have so much

298
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,959
passion for the game and then I'm going

299
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,199
to shoot the Shish back at the pool hall

300
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:40,360
in Rapid City we experience pool's highs

301
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,320
and lows in the same

302
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,360
hour didn't even let me hit a ball ever

303
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,399
the sports gentleman Shane Van boning

304
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,079
wouldn't let us leave without setting us

305
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,279
up to s a trick shot pool may or may not

306
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,079
clean up its act but any sport that can

307
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,000
provide this kind of pure simple thrill

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,639
just go right down the middle yep right

309
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,880
down the middle you reckon it'll survive

310
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,350
just

311
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,839
[Laughter]

312
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,839
fine you got

313
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,839
that
