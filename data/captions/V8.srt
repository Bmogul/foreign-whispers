1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,720
60 Minutes rewind

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,300
say Denzel and most people would know

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,920
you're talking about one of the highest

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,019
paid and most popular actors in

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:13,920
Hollywood

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,440
but 30 years ago Denzel Washington was

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,779
just another unknown struggling New York

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,900
actor today he's playing the lead in a

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,539
Broadway play and making standard union

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,519
wages a fraction of what he'd make in

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,400
Hollywood so we went to see it man I

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,260
remembered a story he told me five years

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,899
ago about an incredible prediction that

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,140
he says started it all

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,079
I was in my mother's beauty shop

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,660
and I was looking in the mirror and I

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,340
saw a woman sitting across the room for

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,600
me

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,180
and she said to my mother bring me a

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,820
piece of paper

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,039
she said I have a prophecy it's the

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,300
God's honest truth I got the piece of

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,920
paper and I'll keep it with me all the

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,420
time

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,399
and she wrote down she said this boy is

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,460
going to speak to millions of people

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,220
I don't talk about that a lot but I've

28
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,380
kind of felt like well maybe I have some

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,900
job to do remember the woman I tell you

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,180
about the prophecy that was 30 years

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,799
that will be 30 years ago next week

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,500
right and then I started acting that

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,780
fall so it's kind of interesting coming

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,840
back now 30 years later about 20 blocks

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,900
from where I started wins

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,299
countrymen

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,119
and love us Denzel Washington's career

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,880
began on the Obscure stage at New York's

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,340
Fordham University but today he is

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,740
headlining on Broadway appearing in a

41
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,420
modern day production of Shakespeare's

42
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,140
Julius Caesar he plays Brutus one of the

43
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,600
leaders of a plot to kill Caesar not

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,200
that I

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,820
but that I love Rome more why did you

46
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,340
decide to do this play now I thought it

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,720
was a great opportunity to get back on

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,060
the stage to get back to my roots and I

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,860
get so few opportunities to get on the

50
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,939
stage

51
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,579
so when I do I really like tackling

52
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,020
Shakespeare which is the toughest and

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,200
the most rewarding

54
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,540
I mean it took me 30 years but I'm I

55
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,420
finally am doing what I wanted to do

56
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,120
when I started the actors I I started

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,239
with in college and we were all snobs

58
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,980
and we thought we would you know make

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,500
600 a week in on Broadway or whatever it

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,879
was back then we didn't think about

61
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,000
going to Hollywood that was some

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Hollywood you didn't do that

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
but he did and it is his acting in those

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,099
Hollywood movies that has made Denzel

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,200

when it comes to one or the other I mean

114
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
you'd like to do both or do you prefer

115
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,120
acting over directing

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
um

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
I look at Clint Eastwood as the model

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,900
that's that's I like the way he's doing

119
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,520
things and that's how I'd like to do it

120
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,440

filmmaking a Hollywood director's chair

123

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,220
Mount Vernon A working class suburb

125
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,560

she scraped together enough money to

155
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,979

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,479

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,020

188
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,460
uh she said your father and I aren't

189
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,900
together anymore

190
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,880
you're going to be with me you know I

191
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,840
don't know what I'm going to do but

192
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,060
we're going to work it out so this is

193
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,680
where I found out my parents were

194
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,139
getting divorced right here right right

195
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,419
here right here I remember it like it

196
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,800
was yesterday

197
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,319
so to answer your question about anger I

198
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,639
think I started getting a little trouble

199
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,280
after that started getting in fights

200
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,979
and almost kicked out of school but his

201
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:57,840
mother talked the Headmaster into giving

202
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,020
him another chance you owe her a lot I

203
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:07,259
ordered everything

204
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,680
I assume you told her that in many ways

205
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,500
the story will continue after this

206
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,259
really intimate House Denzel made the

207
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,479
most of that second chance building a

208
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,940
career that has brought him riches Fame

209
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,819
and critical Acclaim and so why would an

210
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:28,800
actor who makes millions for one movie

211
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,620
risk his reputation by taking a role

212
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,419
that pays Seventeen hundred dollars a

213
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,580
week what do you get out of it I mean

214
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,959
when when you go through this

215
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,140
performance eight times a week

216
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,020
it's like retooling the the lights come

217
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,520
up with the curtain goes up and it's an

218
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,839
actor's medium on stage and and you know

219
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,459
it's it's flying by the seat of your

220
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,019
pants you got to keep going it's live

221
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,060
things happen we're still going through

222
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,279
things things fall and lights don't work

223
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,860
you forget lines or whatever happens and

224
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,959
that's good that's good exercise cell

225
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
phones go off cell phones go off one of

226
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,339
these days I'm going to respond to it in

227
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,140
iambic pentameter answer at that

228
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,540
my Lord my Lord it is for you

229
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,000
Heavens I'd rather coin my heart this

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,980
production has traded ancient Rome's

231
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,339
togas and tunics for suits ties and

232
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,480
camouflage

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,120
it is set in Modern Times And is

234
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,920
intended to be evocative of power

235
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,740
struggles in cities like Washington or

236
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,620
Baghdad what makes the play Julius

237
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,279
Caesar relevant today

238
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,800
well again I mean it's it's what ifs we

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,240
do have

240
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,220
leaders in the world that think they're

241
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,899
Gods I mean and it's not just

242
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,300
governments it's corporations it's you

243
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,120
know unfortunately not a lot has changed

244
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
I think it's a part of the human

245
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,120
condition

246
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,880
are open two weeks ago to mixed reviews

247
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
but Denzel says reviews don't affect him

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,940
because he doesn't read them anyway the

249
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,800
show is nearly sold out for his

250
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,040
scheduled 112 performances that will run

251
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,680
until June performances that give him

252
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,980
something he doesn't get in Hollywood

253
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,860
how do you feel at the end

254
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,440
of a performance

255
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,399
I mean this is not an easy role thankful

256
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,560
you know I run off stage I wipe the

257
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,440
makeup off I say a quick prayer I hear

258
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
the people out there clap and you get a

259
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,700
sense saying oh is it two bows tonight

260
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,000
is it one is it three you know and uh

261
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,040
but a relief

262
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,540
you know

263
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,100
Joy

264
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,980
