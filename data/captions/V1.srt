00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,560
voice and if the name is unfamiliar it's

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,760

this is a woman you don't want to mess

66
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,799
with is a true statement I know what

67
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,400
certain people think of when they look

68
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,879
at me down to the fact that I'm muscular

69
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,959
I'm outspoken and I have short hair I'm

70
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:23,200

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,120
matter what you look like and my box

73
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,760
happens to be if if you're outspoken and

74
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,200
you don't sort of Bend to societal Norms

75
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,360

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,080
reality is the reality is I am the

150
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,879

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,280
screaming at each other throwing things

153
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,160

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,280
drugs I was selling drugs and then I was

155
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,560
kicked out of the house I dropped out of

156
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,000
high school I was off the rails what

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,520
happened on Thanksgiving in

158
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,319
1995 Thanksgiving of 1995 I was at a

159
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,039
rave

160
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,360
and I

161
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,720
overdosed I was

162
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,199
on oh boy

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,520
you almost died yeah remember she says

166
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,759
that was the end of hard drugs for her

167
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,599
and weeks later got her first record

168
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,159
deal as the lead singer in an R&B girl

169
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,560
group but they didn't last long so when

170
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
you're starting out the industry sort of

171
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,319
seems like they've got you going down a

172
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,240
path they paint you with an R&B brush

173
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,759
yes I signed to laf face records we were

174
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,919

179
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,680
didn't work what did they not like I

180
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,800
think they were trying to turn me into

181
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,479
something that I didn't want to be image

182
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,080

00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,120
and I had a voice so I'm relieved I

245
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,279
don't have to fall back on sort of

246
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,800
conventional Beauty and and that doesn't

247
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,920

259
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,160
show that Vegas has ever seen and I

260
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,000
think that I can for a performer like me

261
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,320
to have a stage that doesn't have to

262
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,639
travel oh my God you can do so much so

263
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,519
all these years in what's the hardest

264
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,399
part about your job now I guess that I

265
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,920
keep demanding more and more and more

266
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,519
and more from myself physically

267
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,079
emotionally

268
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,199

against time right how do you keep out

271
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,000
doing that I like going against societal

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,120
Norms when they say a woman has to slow

273
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,160
