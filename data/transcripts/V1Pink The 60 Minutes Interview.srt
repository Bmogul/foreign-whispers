1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
 2023 has been a year of sold out stadium concerts, but only one of the women breaking attendance

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,600
 records has built a global brand singing upside down. High flying stunts are only part of

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,760
 her appeal. Alicia Moore is known as much for her party anthems as her powerhouse voice.

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,360
 And if the name is unfamiliar, it's because she's best known by her one word professional

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,200
 identity. Pink. Pink famously has no filter. And fans who have followed her 25-year career

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,920
 have come to expect her to share every detail of her sometimes troubled story.

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,240
 The story will continue in a moment.

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:51,440
 Do I have this right? You're willing to talk about anything? Any question is fine. There's

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,320
 no offense taken. Yeah, it's all I'm open to all of it. A lot of people in your world

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,280
 thrive on protecting privacy. You're an open book. Why? I guess I look at it in a very

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,840
 specific way. If I'm a mystery to you, how can I expect you to connect with me? And if

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,440
 I'm a person that's desperate for connection, then why would mystery be interesting to me?

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,080
 I want to know you. I want you to know me. All right. Start by coming to one of her concerts.

14
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,760
 We were there for her homecoming shows in Philadelphia last month. One stop on a year

15
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:35,040
 and a half long tour. She's already set attendance records and stadiums around the world.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:51,000
 And sold more than $350 million in tickets. A pink concert is part rock ranger.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:16,400
 Part Broadway spectacle. With some tinkerbell sprinkled in. She belts out her hits while flipping

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,880
 and flying 100 feet in the air. And she does it without lip syncing. When she says she

19
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:37,480
 actually sings better upside down, believe her. Now 44, when she looks out into the crowd,

20
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,760
 she sees a lot more moms and dads. She calls herself and her fans the uncool kids and takes

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,200
 great pleasure in taking on their haters. Whether in her shows or on social media, her messages

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:59,320
 don't mess with them or me. This image that you've created, you've got this famous snarl.

23
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,359
 Yeah, right. I wonder if when that started, the message was, this is a woman that you don't

24
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,280
 want to mess with. Well, this is a woman you don't want to mess with is a true statement.

25
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,920
 I know what certain people think of when they look at me down to the fact that I'm muscular,

26
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,040
 I'm outspoken and I have short hair. I'm possibly a dude, definitely a lesbian. People sort

27
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,240
 of put you in a box no matter what you look like. Then my box happens to be if you're outspoken

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:39,280
 and you don't sort of bend to societal norms, then you're scary and dangerous.

29
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,920
 And the reality is, the reality is I am the goofiest, most fun, loving person that will

30
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,680
 possibly kick your ass if I have to. These days, life is less, get the party started and

31
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,880
 more get these kids to bed. Her six year old son, Jamison and 12 year old daughter, Willow,

32
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,520
 are often on tour with her, writing their scooters on stage during sound checks. For

33
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,720
 the hometown show in Philly, Pink's husband, Motocross star, Carrie Hart was there and

34
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,000
 so was her mom, Judy. This is our tour library backstage. There's a library where the team

35
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,360
 swaps books. Pink has a romantic novel she needs to return. We have a little sign in

36
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,280
 she you actually have a sign in your side. I have a thing, but we don't have that. So

37
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
 I've been backstage for other artists and some of the things I've seen are a lot of

38
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,599
 booze. Yeah, a lot of party. Cool. My dresser, I'm used to be like whiskey and cigarettes,

39
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:47,719
 then it was ball pits and stuffed animals. When she's not on the road, she's home in Southern

40
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:54,039
 California. This is where she's Alicia Moore, a Mohawk wearing mom who baked sourdough and

41
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,880
 is part of the PTA. She's either driving for school drop off or driving a forklift

42
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,040
 on her 25 acre vineyard. She says she schooled herself on the science of wine making by studying

43
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:15,040
 late into the night after her shows. So do I have this correct? You don't make pink rosé.

44
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,520
 I do not make pink rosé. My grandash is it looks like a white wine. Occasionally it's

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:27,240
 a bit peach, but you drink it. I drink a lot. Well, biggie smalls once said never get

46
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,800
 high on your own supply. But you started I do make a lot of wine. Home is also where she

47
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,760
 makes music. It's my music room. It's really great. Yeah, she's a writer on most of her songs

48
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,760
 and says no topic is off limits. Not even the ups and downs in her marriage. And you

49
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,720
 taught yourself to play on this sort of kind of I mean, I can play haves of songs. One

50
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,040
 of my favorite songs is Make You Feel My Love. And I played this every day during COVID.

51
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,480
 This is a Bob Dylan song made most recently famous by Adele.

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,480
 That's one of my favorite songs.

53
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:17,240
 When the rain is blowing in your face. And the world is on your case. I could offer you

54
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:31,720
 woman brains to make you feel my love. I played that every day. Wow. Until I was good enough to go on stage and play an instrument.

55
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,240
 She grew up singing opera and gospel in Doyle's town, Pennsylvania. But she says tension at home made her desperate to leave.

56
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,840
 She calls her relationship with her father Jim Moore complicated. He served in Vietnam and passed away two years ago.

57
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,440
 As a teen arguments with her mother were so bad, pink says one fight got physical and her mom fell down stairs.

58
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,480
 She now calls that her one regret in life. You said you were the kid that other moms didn't want their kids to play with.

59
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:09,080
 Why? I was a punk. I had a mouth. I was I had a chip on my shoulder. Basically I grew up in a house where every day

60
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,120
 my parents were screaming at each other throwing things, hated each other. And then I got into drugs.

61
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,720
 I was selling drugs. And then I was kicked out of the house. I dropped out of high school. That was off the rails.

62
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,400
 What happened on Thanksgiving in 1995?

63
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:34,359
 Thanksgiving of 1995. I was at a rave and I overdosed. I was on...

64
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:45,400
 Oh boy. Ecstasy, angel dust, crystal, all kinds of things. And then I was out done too much.

65
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,840
 You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

66
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,880
 She says that was the end of hard drugs for her. And weeks later got her first record deal as the lead singer

67
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,320
 in an R&B girl group. But they didn't last long.

68
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,640
 So when you're starting out, the industry sort of seems like they've got you going down a path.

69
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:11,080
 They paint you with an R&B brush. Yes, I signed to LaFace Records. We were the token white girls on a black label.

70
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:18,440
 I was told to take etiquette classes very early on. They wanted me to learn how to wear dresses and use the right fork.

71
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,360
 How that work out? I went once, but it didn't work.

72
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,160
 What did they not like? I think they were trying to turn me into something that I didn't want to be.

73
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,680
 Images everything in this business.

74
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,440
 Using her teenage nickname Pink, she went solo and her first album was an R&B double platinum success.

75
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,840
 She then broadened her sound to include rock and pop.

76
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,840
 And not so subtly named her next album, Miss Unda Stood.

77
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,920
 So you better get the song out.

78
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,480
 How?

79
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,360
 It was a career defining hit, selling 15 million copies around the world.

80
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,480
 You'd said in the past it felt like you were never winning the popularity contest among your peers.

81
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,440
 What do you mean by that?

82
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,880
 We've sold 3 million tickets in the last six months, but you don't really hear about it unless you

83
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,200
 went. So at the end of the day, do I give a s***? Who talks about me?

84
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,840
 As long as the mom and the daughter or the dad who's in the pink t-shirt,

85
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,520
 as well as his daughter and her three friends had a fantastic time,

86
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,560
 or the gay couple that came together and felt super safe at my show because no one heckled them.

87
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
 That's what really matters.

88
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,000
 And then there's this.

89
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,400
 We wanted to know how she does it, singing upside down as an asthmatic no less.

90
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,240
 Well, it took a lot of childhood gymnastics classes and tortured training sessions with her

91
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
 aerialist coach, Dre O'Lebar.

92
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,680
 Okay, tighten up your stomach.

93
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,400
 Okay, ready?

94
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,880
 Be nice.

95
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,400
 Not sink.

96
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,160
 Homeowner.

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,600
 Just because it powers us and me gonna die, you gotta get a walk.

98
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,680
 I'm not just a singer, I'm a gymnast. I can do all kinds of things.

99
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,120
 I'm physical. This body, like, there's the muscles that scare people, it's my power.

100
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,600
 Right? It's like, I don't eat well to look good.

101
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,160
 I eat well to go far, fast and hard.

102
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,360
 At 5'3", she is all muscle and make no mistake as tough as she looks.

103
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,680
 I realize that the machete that I've always carried, this metaphorical machete that I've

104
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,160
 always carried that made me a really difficult kid is what makes me really good at what I did today.

105
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,000
 And it makes me a survivor.

106
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,520
 Do you feel like you needed that hard edge, that machete to climb as far as you've climbed in this

107
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,239
 business? Absolutely. Absolutely. I never got a record deal because I was cute.

108
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,959
 I got a record deal because I was fiery. I had a lot to say and I had a voice.

109
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:37,880
 So, I'm relieved I don't have to fall back on sort of conventional beauty and

110
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:44,520
 that doesn't have to be my thing and I don't have to keep that up either as I age. I don't have to be that.

111
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,400
 I can be all of this. She won't need a plan be anytime soon, but as she told us at midnight over a

112
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,360
 glass of wine in her dressing room in Philadelphia, she is planning the next chapter.

113
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,640
 It's what any self-respecting acrobatic, sequin loving entertainer would do, a Las Vegas residency.

114
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,840
 I would like to have the best show that Vegas has ever seen and I think that I can.

115
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,160
 For a performer like me to have a stage that doesn't have to travel.

116
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:27,560
 Oh my god, you can do so much. So all these years in, what's the hardest part about your job now?

117
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,400
 I guess that I keep demanding more and more and more and more from myself physically, emotionally,

118
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:43,079
 spiritually, vocally. I want to raise the bar all the time and I'm sort of going against time,

119
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:51,720
 right? How do you keep out doing that? I like going against societal norms when they say a woman has to

120
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,880
 slow down, become smaller, take up less space, calm down. No, absolutely not. Why? Who says,

121
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,640
 why can't we ride it till the wheels fall off? It's not a plan I'm doing.

122
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:20,280
 Go backstage with pink after a concert. Come on, get it. At 60 minutes overtime.com.
