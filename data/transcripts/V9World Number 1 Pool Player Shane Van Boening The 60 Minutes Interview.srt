1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
 You'd expect a 600-year-old sport to have played through its identity crisis, not the case

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,020
 for pool. The sport's very name comes from pooling money to determine odds, and wadring

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,860
 lens pool mystique. Hustling and pool go together like acoustic and chalk, but that's as much

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,480
 a curse as a blessing. How can a sport thrive at the highest level when so much of it exists

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,300
 in the shadows? Well, here comes Shane Van Boning from Rapid City. As we first told you

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,300
 in December, at age 39 with no interest in gambling, Van Boning is arguably the best American

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,560
 player ever to break a rack, and was ranked number one in the world for 2022. He also happens

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,640
 to be deaf. Can the South Dakota kid help turn pool popular in bars and basements, but

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:59,280
 not on TV into a proper pro sport? We hit the circuit with him to find out.

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,640
 The story will continue in a moment.

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,600
 Another day, another casino hotel, Shane Van Boning spends 300 days a year on the road playing

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,320
 professional pool. Today he's clocking in early at the jamboree of American pool tournaments,

13
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,119
 the Derby City Classic.

14
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,000
 Held every January outside Louisville, Derby City is a colorful expression of pool split

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,679
 personality. Downstairs a felt ocean drawing dozens of the world's best practitioners. They

16
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:38,560
 compete 12 hours a day for nine days in multiple events. This winner is smiling ear to ear

17
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,600
 and his check tops out at $16,000. But upstairs it's a different economy. Behold pool's zestier

18
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,000
 side. Pop up action room standing room only where pros, amateurs and wannabes alike come

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,960
 to the table for unofficial competition. The signs say no smoking and no gambling, and

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,639
 we short in see any smoking. Ten sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars, big timber they

21
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:11,240
 call it, change hands until the sun comes up. One player we didn't see gambling upstairs,

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,880
 Shane Van Boning. A generational talent known for his killer break.

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,359
 Van Boning has won the US Open five times in been named player of the decade. Depth since

24
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,000
 birth he wears hearing aids and shuts down any question this makes it harder for him to

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,760
 play pool. It's actually a big advantage for me. How's that? You know when I play a full

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,560
 tournament I can just shut it off. Do you shut your hearing aids off on the play? When

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,200
 I won my first US Open, I had everything off I would focus total siles. Yes. I'm totally

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:51,480
 like 100% zone in. Never more zoned in than in 2018 when he led the United States to

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,119
 victory over Europe at the Moscone Cup. Pools answer to golf's rider cup. And he is going

30
00:02:57,119 --> 00:03:03,179
 for it. He closed it out with an off angle long distance one nine combo. This high risk

31
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:12,480
 high reward pressure packed shot. What a shot. Shane Van Boning and team USA. Unbelievable

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,600
 finish. Think you could have made that shot. We went to Rapid City, South Dakota, a side pocket

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,359
 of America to Van Boning's pool hall where he explained that making balls disappear into

34
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:30,000
 pockets is only half of pool excellence. It's also about setting up your next shots.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,959
 Cueball control they call it. And I'm going to make the cue ball stop right here so I can shoot

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:44,560
 the two inside. Then I'm going to say, well, you did that. How? How did you do that?

37
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,640
 Just hit it right below center. So now it lines up that next ball perfectly. Yeah. I'm so

38
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,440
 struck by the geometry of all this. Yeah, I love geometry. He's all about the angles.

39
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,800
 Van Boning says he can see every angle on the table. A six sense that comes from practicing

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,000
 as much as 10 hours a day, shooting half a million balls a year. I want to make the shot

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
 perfect. You know, the only way to hit a perfect you got to do it over and over and over.

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,120
 Can you be perfect in the sport? No. I try to show how it's done all these years.

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,560
 Van Boning comes by it honestly. His grandfather Gary Bloomberg, a known trick shot artist,

44
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,480
 opened pool halls off by 90. Easy access for hustlers passing across the great plains. But

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,800
 these rooms were family friendly places. So much so Shane got his first pool cue when he was two

46
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 and went to the pool room every day after school. Not just to play but to escape kids who picked on him

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,360
 for being deaf. How bad did it get? The kid was start throwing rocks at me. They would put gum in

48
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,160
 my hair and then I would go home to my mom and I'd be going home crying, you know, and then

49
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,080
 she made me feel better by asking me, you want to go to the pool? Why did coming to the pool room

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,280
 make you feel better? You know when you're walking to the pool and what do you see? You know, you see

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,320
 people having a good time. But it was more than that. He had prodigious ability for thinking multiple

52
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,880
 strokes ahead. When Van Boning was 18, he hit the road. He and his uncle loaded into an RV looking

53
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,440
 for money games. Came to play pools, bats. Of course they did. The hustler, that stealth road man,

54
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,159
 armed only with a wooden stick and confidence, divorcing the locals from their cash,

55
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:40,560
 had been romanticized for decades, not least by Paul Newman. This reporter was so taken by pool

56
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,400
 hustling he once wrote a book about it. For Van Boning, the romance hit the rocks abruptly.

57
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,560
 I actually was playing the pool in Tennessee and I was playing this guy for money and we were

58
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
 playing for a whole lot and he was losing and he picked up the keyboard and threw it at me.

59
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,440
 Where'd he hit you? Hit me right on the chest. It's the kind of thing you do to start a fight.

60
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,000
 Yeah. How'd you react? I told my uncle I said, I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to live

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,080
 on a road anymore. It's just too dangerous. Here we go for the title. He chose to go legit and

62
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,080
 began playing in winning proper tournaments, though less lucrative than the rambling gambling life

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,039
 Van Boning enjoyed being a professional. Did you worry that coming in off the road was going to

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,560
 impact your finances? I know some of the pool players like the top pool players were making money

65
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,360
 so if they can do it, I can do it. But pool is a deceptively tricky sport. Next up to superpowers

66
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,520
 Just ask Shane Scottish counterpark Jason Shaw, another top player. Earlier this year,

67
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,320
 Shaw holed up in a Virginia pool room for five days and broke the straight pool record

68
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,880
 making 714 shots in a row. The stuff that happens in pool will completely screw your brain up.

69
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,040
 What do you mean? You'll see shots and you'll be like, how did that happen? You'll hear that

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,000
 all day. How did that land over there? Did you see that? How did that went in? In pool, you see

71
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,400
 every game something weird will happen. Does that make it more exhilarating or more frustrating?

72
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,480
 Both mentally you want to flip the table at some point. You ever flip the table? No, I've fought

73
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,200
 about it a few times. People come in and say, how hard could it be? It's just a rectangle with

74
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,040
 six packets. Yeah, and then 20 minutes later there's still 15 balls on the table. They're not

75
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,240
 pausing the ball and the guys like stretching their head like, thought this was easy. It's not.

76
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,840
 We watched you at Derby City play Jason Shaw. Jason Hoop? Yeah.

77
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,560
 The arrival? Yeah, it's been going on for several years now. He's a great player and

78
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,520
 well you're going to have a battle. You okay with that? Yeah, you have to step losing.

79
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,200
 If you don't want to step losing you're going to go crazy. I'll stick his aside right here.

80
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,520
 If having a rival is central to being an elite athlete so is this, leaving time to clear your head.

81
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:10,159
 So it was we found ourselves following Shane Van Boning out on to pack Tola Lake in the Black Hills.

82
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,560
 Van Boning goes fishing season be damned every morning when he's back home. We didn't catch any fish.

83
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,440
 We did catch Van Boning's drift though. His take on the virtues of complete silence.

84
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,919
 Vanity plate notwithstanding few extravagances come with being number one in pool.

85
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:40,960
 The Ragtag Pro Tour barely televised in the US struggles to draw much interest or investment

86
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,319
 outside of pool die hard. How many sponsors do you have? I have six sponsors.

87
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,480
 Cues and tables and pool products. Yes. And any sponsors outside of pool? No. What can a top

88
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,880
 player make? Top player and pool can make only a fish finish. After a spanishes maybe five

89
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
 fish. No one's making a million bucks. No. That's a pool player. Never happened.

90
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,400
 Van Boning says cleaning up the sport, doing away with backroom money games,

91
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,800
 with lower big corporate sponsors, big media deals, and grow professional pool.

92
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
 We saw first hand his discomfort with gambling and all that comes with it.

93
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
 When we interviewed you in Derby City, I don't know if you remember the interview was interrupted.

94
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,040
 Do you recall what happened? Oh, the gambling. Was that what happened? Yeah.

95
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,760
 It was morning at Derby City and the action upstairs from the night before was still simmering.

96
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,680
 Over the course of a few minutes two players who'd bet on a game nearly came to blow.

97
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,319
 You cannot gamble. Van Boning could only shake his head. It got to be a clean sport.

98
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,040
 Ender pro pools, unlikely new guardian, Emily Fraser of the British sports promoter Matru.

99
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:02,000
 The company recently revamped pro darts and snooker in the UK,

100
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,319
 streamlining their circuits and turning top players into celebrities who make millions.

101
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
 That's where the trophy sits. Fraser is tasked with doing the same for pool,

102
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,040
 and she says gambling is the least of her worries. What's the state of professional pool today?

103
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,760
 Ah, an absolute mess. Why do you say that? The first ever US Open that I did in 2019.

104
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,960
 Oh my gosh, the players turned up. They were in jeans. When I'm going,

105
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,880
 hang on a second, what's happening here? Why is this guy turning up in jeans?

106
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,840
 Fraser has asked pro players to dress the part, but you won't ask them to give up their side hustles.

107
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,600
 Now, all of the basement tables and the money matches, I think that's brilliant.

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,080
 And that can still... Yeah, I think that's fantastic because it's got the history behind it.

109
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,680
 You're okay if people are still, they're gambling and playing money games.

110
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,760
 As far as I'm concerned, in a couple years time, they won't need to have any money matches.

111
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,520
 It'll be absolute. The market will do its thing.

112
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,640
 Exactly, but right now, it's not viewed as this professional sport.

113
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,240
 And it has all the ingredients to be one.

114
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,240
 She standardized the format. This is commercialized sponsor-friendly

115
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,760
 nine-ball, not the solids and stripes eight-ball you've likely played.

116
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:20,400
 In October at the US Open, held in Atlantic City, Fraser brought in bigger live audiences

117
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,439
 and ramped up TV production. She's kept one pool hallmark, the smoke-filled room.

118
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
 Close, but no cigar. There's a machine puffing away in the corner.

119
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
 When the smoke cleared, there was Shane Van Boney.

120
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,600
 He was fresh off winning his first world championship,

121
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,360
 sealing his status atop the sport.

122
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,280
 He confided to us that he'd slept with the trophy for a month.

123
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,040
 Van Boney is mobbed at pool tournaments, but can still walk through an airport unbothered.

124
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
 Well, he's no LeBron James and I totally understand that and I recognize that.

125
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,360
 It's our job to turn that around. It is our responsibility to turn

126
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,240
 that world number one prize money from $80,000 to a million.

127
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,280
 So it's prize money. It's more events and let's get these players known.

128
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,880
 You've got to fall in love with them. Are they loveable?

129
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
 Yes, some of them.

130
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,200
 The health of the sport also depends on minting a new generation of elite players.

131
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,760
 So this tournament had a junior division held alongside the pros and named

132
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,880
 what else the Shane Van Boney junior opened.

133
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,080
 These are future pros?

134
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,400
 Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely.

135
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,480
 They have so much passion for the game.

136
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
 And then I'm going to shoot the sish.

137
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,000
 Back at the pool hall in Rapid City, we experience pools, highs and lows in the same hour.

138
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,439
 You didn't even let me hit a ball.

139
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,400
 Ever the sports gentleman, Shane Van Boney wouldn't let us leave without setting us up to

140
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,640
 sink a trick shot. Pool, May or may not clean up its act.

141
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,959
 But any sport that can provide this kind of pure, simple thrill.

142
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,160
 Let's go right down the middle.

143
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,600
 Yep, right down the middle.

144
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,439
 You reckon it'll survive just fine.

145
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,319
 You got that.
