1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 General Mark Milley completed a four-year term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,160
 the nation's highest-ranking military officer on September 30th.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,960
 He told us he spent most of his time working to avoid a direct conflict with Russia and

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,360
 China, while the country watched him have a very public falling out with former President

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,720
 Trump, the man who picked him for the job.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,479
 More Milley's time serving President Joe Biden had its own challenges, including America's

7
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:35,720
 calamitous withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as providing Ukraine with billions of

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,879
 dollars worth of American military equipment.

9
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,640
 A few hours before we sat down with the general at the Pentagon, he had his final phone call

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,320
 with the commander of Ukraine's armed forces.

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,519
 The story will continue in a moment.

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,400
 The counteroffensive that the Ukrainians are running is still ongoing.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,240
 The progress has many, many people have noted it is slow, but it is steady, and they are

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,800
 making progress on a day-to-day basis.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,480
 But expelling 200,000 Russian soldiers, no easy tasks.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 Very hard, very hard.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,560
 How long is this going to look like this, a year or five years?

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,600
 Well, you can't put a time on it, but it will be a considerable length of time, and it's

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,080
 going to be long and hard and very bloody.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,440
 Russia occupies 41,000 square miles of Ukraine.

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,039
 The frontline extends about the distance from Atlanta to Washington, D.C.

22
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:32,800
 In Congress this past week, Republicans ended Kevin McCarthy's speakership, and for now

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,880
 more aid to Ukraine.

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,200
 According to the White House of the $113 billion already committed, there is only enough left

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,080
 to last a few more months.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,520
 With all of the issues facing Americans at home, why is this worth it?

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,399
 If Ukraine loses and Putin wins, I think you would be certainly increasing if not doubling

28
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,280
 your defense budget in the years ahead, and you will increase the probability of great

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
 power war in the next 10 to 15 years.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,720
 I think it would be a very dangerous situation if Putin is allowed to win.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,479
 Ukraine, Russia obviously is what drives us meeting today.

32
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,859
 The chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the commander-in-chiefs principal military advisor, but

33
00:02:10,859 --> 00:02:13,120
 commands no troops in battle.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
 I am obligated, regardless of consequences, to give my advice to the President, but no

35
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,680
 President is obligated to follow that advice.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,200
 This past August, General Milley invited us aboard the USS Constitution in Boston Harbor,

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
 not far from where he grew up.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,560
 With the only military in the world, that swears an oath not to a king, a queen, a tyrant,

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,360
 a would-be tyrant, or a dictator, we swear an oath to an idea, the idea that is American,

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,480
 and it's embodied in that document the Constitution, which sets up our form of government.

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,280
 In 2021, General Milley had counseled President Biden to keep 2,500 troops in and around

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
 Kabul.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,959
 Instead, Mr. Biden ordered a complete withdrawal to end America's longest war after 20 years.

44
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,160
 The disaster that followed will be part of both of their legacies.

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,560
 I go through the entire withdrawal from Afghanistan, chapter in verse all the time.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
 That was a strategic failure for the United States.

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,680
 The enemy occupied the capital city of the country that you were supportive.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
 So to me, that hurts.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,560
 It hurts a big way.

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
 But no matter what pain I feel or anyone else feels, nothing comes even close to the

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
 pain of those that were killed.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:28,520
 To those who served in Afghanistan for two decades and lost family members and friends

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,600
 and wonder, was it worth it?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
 That's always the question, right?

55
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,480
 So a 2004 and 61 killed in action by the enemy in Afghanistan over 20 years.

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
 Was it worth it?

57
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,959
 But I can't answer that for other people.

58
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:44,760
 This is a tough business that we're in, this military business.

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,679
 It's unforgiving, the crucible of combat's unforgiving.

60
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,160
 People die, they lose their arms, they lose their legs.

61
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,120
 It's an incredibly difficult life.

62
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,320
 But is it worth it?

63
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,399
 Look around you.

64
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,399
 Ask yourself the question.

65
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:01,480
 For me, I've answered it many times over and that's why I stay in uniform and that's

66
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,120
 why I maintain my oath.

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,200
 His commitment to that oath would be both tested and questioned by Donald Trump.

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:17,880
 While their relationship began with kind words, after the January 6th insurrection, the

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,440
 two men would not speak again.

70
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,760
 Their publicist strangement started in the spring of 2020 when protests for racial justice

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,000
 some violent spread across the country, including to Washington, D.C.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,880
 Perhaps more than any other chairman in the role you have become ensnurled in politics

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
 and arguably threats to the Constitution.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,720
 What have you learned from that?

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,760
 I think it's important to keep your North Star, which is the Constitution.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,600
 We the military are not only apolitical, we are nonpartisan.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 You can't pick sides.

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
 June 1st, 2020.

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
 Was that a turning point for you as chairman?

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
 I think it was, yeah.

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,280
 I realized that they stepped into a political minefield and I shouldn't have.

82
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,880
 He's talking about the day when President Trump threatened to invoke the insurrection act

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,720
 and deploy the U.S. Army to put down the unrest on America's streets.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,760
 On the evening of June 1st, after demonstrators near the White House were removed by force,

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,040
 Chairman Milley, trust in battle fatigues, joined President Trump and members of his cabinet

86
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:35,160
 in a march across Lafayette Square to St. John's Church, where Mr. Trump posed for photographs.

87
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,560
 Ten days later, General Milley apologized in a speech to graduates of the National Defense University.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,040
 My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,240
 in domestic politics.

90
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,040
 As a commissioned, uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I've learned from.

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,680
 It's rare for a chairman to apologize publicly.

92
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,000
 Well, you know, I grew up here in Boston.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,920
 I was Catholic and my mother and father taught me that when you make a mistake, you admit it,

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,520
 you go to confession, say, 10 Hail Mary's and I'll father.

95
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,280
 Everybody makes mistakes and the key is how you deal with the mistake.

96
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,320
 After you apologized, former President Trump said you choked like a dog.

97
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,520
 Yeah, I'm not going to come at done anything the former president has said or not said.

98
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,240
 General Milley did tell us he was so disillusioned with the former president's actions he nearly resigned.

99
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,480
 Instead, according to former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, he and the general made a pact

100
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,560
 to protect the military from becoming politicized or misused.

101
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,120
 It's also been reported that you spent several days, several drafts of resignation letters.

102
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,640
 I was very struck by the one that was published.

103
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,640
 In which you said to the president, it is my deeply held belief that you are ruining the international order,

104
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:58,039
 causing significant damage to our country overseas that was fought so hard by the greatest generation in 1945.

105
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,840
 That generation has fought against fascism, has fought against Nazism, has fought against extremism.

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,599
 It's now obvious to me that you don't understand that world order.

107
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,120
 You don't think Donald Trump understood what World War II was fought over?

108
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,920
 I don't know what former President Trump understood about World War II or anything else.

109
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:31,400
 I can tell you that from 1914 to 1945, 150 million people or their buds were slaughtered in the conduct of Great Power War.

110
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,600
 In 1945, the United States took the initiative and drafted up a set of rules that govern the world to this day.

111
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,640
 Those rules are under stress internationally.

112
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,159
 The President Putin is a direct frontal assault on those rules.

113
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,440
 China is trying to revise those rules to their own benefit.

114
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,599
 But that's one thing to say that China is threatening that world order and Russia is threatening that world order.

115
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:01,640
 To say that the commander-in-chief Donald Trump was ruining the international order and causing significant damage,

116
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,440
 what did you see that caused you to write that?

117
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
 I would say that...

118
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,080
 It's got to be more than walking into Lafayette Square in uniform.

119
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,599
 There was a wide variety of initiatives that were ongoing.

120
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,359
 One of them, of course, was throwing troops out of NATO.

121
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:18,840
 Those were initiatives that placed at risk.

122
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,440
 I think America's role in the world.

123
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:29,440
 Now, that is the opposite of what my parents and 18 million others wore the uniform for World War II to defeat.

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,120
 General Milley doesn't just revere the greatest generation.

125
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,960
 He was raised by it.

126
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,240
 His father was a Navy medic who served in the Pacific campaign, including at the Battle of Iwojima.

127
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,240
 His mother joined the naval reserve to work as a nurse.

128
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,960
 Well, this was and still remains a very patriotic neighborhood.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,560
 After the war, they settled in Winchester, a small town north of Boston.

130
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,040
 Almost every single male and female parent that was here,

131
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,360
 they were all World War II veterans of one kind or another.

132
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,160
 The whole block really, a lot of people.

133
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,319
 And 100% and interesting, no officers.

134
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:10,719
 These were 100% illicit and they had their own opinions about this too.

135
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,800
 Including your parents, probably.

136
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,280
 During high school, he was recruited to play ice hockey at Princeton University

137
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,360
 and decided to join the Reserve Officers Training Corps or ROTC.

138
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,280
 After graduating in 1980, he went on to become a paratrooper and serve in special forces.

139
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,360
 He did one combat tour in Iraq and three in Afghanistan.

140
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,080
 This past May, he returned to Princeton to commission the graduating ROTC class.

141
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
 Congratulations to everyone of you.

142
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:49,280
 And took a particular interest in a few of the young officers whose language skills are currently in high demand.

143
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,520
 I speak Chinese, sir.

144
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,280
 Chinese is really, really important to us.

145
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,920
 Anybody else speak Chinese?

146
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,320
 Whoa, one, two, three, four, five.

147
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,920
 If you speak Chinese, if you don't mind, I'd like to get your names.

148
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:03,880
 And we'll see where life takes you guys.

149
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,680
 We, the United States, need to take the challenge, the military challenge of China extraordinarily seriously.

150
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,880
 How concerned are you that military to military communications are not happening right now with China?

151
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,400
 Yeah, I think we need to get that established.

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,760
 We had them for a period of time and then they've dropped off.

153
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,199
 So, channels of communication are important in order to de-escalate in time of crisis.

154
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,000
 General Milley says he held a total of five calls with his Chinese military counterparts

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,840
 during the Trump and Biden administrations.

156
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,240
 But it was his last two calls during the final months of the Trump presidency

157
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,640
 that got the attention of the press, Congress, and the former president himself.

158
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,520
 Why did you think it was so important to call your Chinese military counterpart

159
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,840
 in the aftermath of the January 6th attacks?

160
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,440
 That's an example of de-escalation.

161
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,000
 So, there was clear indications that the Chinese were very concerned

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,680
 about what they were observing here in the United States.

163
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,680
 Did you see some movement of Chinese military equipment?

164
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
 I won't go over anything classified.

165
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,880
 So, I won't discuss exactly what we saw or didn't see or what we heard or didn't hear.

166
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,360
 I will just say that there was clear indications that the Chinese were very concerned.

167
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,480
 President Trump recently said that your dealings with China were so egregious that in times gone by,

168
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,960
 that the punishment would have been death.

169
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
 It's right, he said that.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,200
 But for the record, was there anything inappropriate or treasonous about the calls you made to China?

171
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,400
 Absolutely not, zero, none.

172
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,680
 And now they're authorizing, they're coordinated.

173
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
 Congress knows that.

174
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,240
 We've answered these questions several different times in writing.

175
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,600
 Were you giving the Chinese information about thinking of the president of the United States?

176
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,840
 The specific conversation was, I think, in accordance with the intent of the Secretary of Defense,

177
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,280
 which was to make sure the Chinese knew that we were not going to attack them.

178
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,480
 Why did the Chinese think that the U.S. under, then President Trump was going to attack them?

179
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,520
 The Chinese were concerned about what it's commonly referred to in the English language,

180
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,880
 like an October surprise, wag the dog sort of thing.

181
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,320
 They were wrong, they were not reading us right.

182
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,200
 Look, the President Trump was not going to attack China, and they needed to know that.

183
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,600
 China, Russia, and the war in Ukraine are now the problem of his successor.

184
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,080
 Air Force General Charles Q. Brown, Jr.

185
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,400
 There are also areas of concern closer to home.

186
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,720
 Last year, the Army missed its recruiting numbers by 15,000 soldiers.

187
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,280
 The worst shortfall in decades.

188
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,680
 Confidence in the U.S. military is at its lowest in two decades.

189
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
 Do you bear any personal responsibility for that?

190
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
 Absolutely.

191
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,080
 I think as the leader of the military, the uniform military, I think that I am part of that for sure.

192
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,840
 I think the walk from the White House to the St. John's Church, I think that helped

193
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
 create some of that.

194
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,000
 I think the withdrawal from Afghanistan helped create some of that.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,480
 But I would also say the United States military is still one of the most respected institutions

196
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,280
 in the United States by a long shot, by a huge margin.

197
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:13,920
 I think we've taken a slip back a little bit, and I think we need to improve on that.

198
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,920
 General Mark Milley on the Future of Warfare.

199
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 Does it make war more likely?

200
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 It could.
