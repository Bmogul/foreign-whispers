1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 60 minutes rewind.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,440
 Say Denzel and most people would know you're talking about one of the highest paid and

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,200
 most popular actors in Hollywood.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,760
 But 30 years ago Denzel Washington was just another unknown struggling New York actor.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,640
 Today he's playing the lead in a Broadway play and making standard union wages, a fraction

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,480
 of what he'd make in Hollywood.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,960
 So we went to see him and I remember the story he told me five years ago about an incredible

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,280
 prediction that he says started it all.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,280
 I was in my mother's beauty shop and I was looking in the mirror and I saw a woman sitting

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,920
 across the room for me.

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,040
 And she said to my mother, bring me a piece of paper.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,160
 She's got a prophecy.

13
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,639
 It's the guy's honest truth.

14
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:57,680
 I got the piece of paper and I keep it with me all the time.

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,640
 And she wrote down, she said this boy is going to speak to millions of people.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,240
 I don't talk about that a lot but I've kind of felt like well maybe I have some job to

17
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
 do.

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,360
 Remember the woman I tell you about the prophecy?

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,080
 That was 30 years, that will be 30 years ago next week.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
 Right.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,600
 And then I started acting that fall.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
 So it's kind of interesting coming back now 30 years later, about 20 blocks from where

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
 I started.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,640
 Roman's country made it.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,520
 Dins our Washington's career began on the obscure stage at New York's Fordham University.

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,720
 But today he is headlining on Broadway appearing in a modern day production of Shakespeare's

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,399
 Julius Caesar.

28
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,320
 He plays Brutus, one of the leaders of a plot to kill Caesar.

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,440
 Not that I love Caesar less.

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,240
 But that I love Rome more.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,720
 Why did you decide to do this play now?

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 I thought it was a great opportunity to get back on the stage, to get back to my roots.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,280
 And I get so few opportunities to get on the stage.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,400
 So when I do I really like tackling Shakespeare which is the toughest and the most rewarding.

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,280
 There is no terror in castles in your threats.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,720
 I mean it took me 30 years but I'm finally doing what I wanted to do when I started.

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,840
 The actors I started with in college and we were all snobs and we thought we would make

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,160
 $600 a week in on Broadway or whatever it was back then.

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,200
 We didn't think about going to Hollywood.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,960
 That was some Hollywood.

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,760
 You didn't do that.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
 But he did.

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,160
 And it is his acting in those Hollywood movies that has made Dins our Washington a household

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
 name.

45
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:48,480
 He's been in more than 30 feature films in one two Academy Awards.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,079
 Best supporting actor for his portrayal of a runaway slave in the film Glory.

47
00:02:53,079 --> 00:03:01,359
 And in 2002, best actor for his performance as the dirty cop Alonzo Harris in training

48
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,359
 day.

49
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,359
 I ain't holding no hands.

50
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:04,359
 I understand I ain't babysitting.

51
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:05,359
 You got today.

52
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,680
 And today I'm going to show me who and what you made of.

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,720
 His name has become synonymous with Hollywood box office blockbusters.

54
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,040
 Most recently he played Major Ben Marco in a remake of the Manchurian candidate.

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,680
 Somebody got into our heads with big steel toe boots.

56
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,200
 The cable cut isn't a chain so they went to town.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
 You've been working a lot since we talked five years ago.

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,440
 You've done what?

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
 Seven films since then?

60
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 Ever?

61
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
 Since what year was it?

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 29.

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
 29.

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 Okay.

65
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,440
 I mean, it's a lot of work.

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,359
 Uh, is it?

67
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,960
 I mean, work is like, you know, garbage man is work.

68
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
 I'm acting is not work.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,640
 Acting is a privilege and it's a craft and all of those things, but it's not work.

70
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,040
 I read that you got 20 million in film now.

71
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,600
 I heard you make that kind of money too.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
 I'm not there yet.

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 Yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
 Oh, you finished.

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
 I thought I was just getting started.

76
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,560
 I wanted to tell you something, son, to me, I slipped your mind.

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
 But you are dressing the superior officer.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
 You want to stand me?

79
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,200
 In 2002, in the film Antoine Fisher, Denzel played a Navy psychiatrist counseling a troubled

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,200
 sailor.

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
 Cut, cut, okay.

82
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,440
 In addition, tackling a new role as the film's director.

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,159
 I want you to face right in our face that's for our first shot, you know?

84
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:31,159
 Did you enjoy, director?

85
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,159
 Absolutely.

86
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,159
 I'm going to do it again.

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,400
 When it comes to one or the other, I mean, you'd like to do both or do you prefer acting

88
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
 over directing?

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,640
 Um, I look at Clint Eastwood as the model.

90
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,160
 That's, I like the way he's doing things and that's how I'd like to do it.

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,960
 Just segue right on into more and more filmmaking.

92
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,160
 A Hollywood director's chair is a long way from where he grew up in Mount Vernon, a working

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,880
 class suburb outside New York City.

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
 His mother, Lenis, managed that beauty shop.

95
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,320
 His father, Denzel Sr., was a Pentecostal preacher who held down two other jobs.

96
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,400
 Denzel went to church every Sunday, but dreamed of becoming a professional athlete.

97
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,000
 He spent all of his free time here at what was then the boys club.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,120
 This was an important place for you.

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 Yep.

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
 I lived here.

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,520
 My mother had to come get me.

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,960
 So you had a time when you had to come home?

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,360
 Nine o'clock, man.

104
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 I had a time.

105
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,400
 I knew I had to get to the fish market by 8.54 and buy the chicken joint by 8.56 in order

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
 to make it home by nine o'clock.

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,000
 Did she ever have to come looking for you?

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 She did.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 She would.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,600
 We were in the park and she came.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,960
 And we were like, oh, I see your mom's here and I got in the car and she was screaming.

112
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,160
 So I kind of look at everybody.

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,240
 I have to window like, you know, I got this.

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,440
 As I was, as I was turning around, pow!

115
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,960
 So I put my head under the dashboard.

116
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
 Just drive, mom.

117
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
 Just drive.

118
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,400
 Denzel says his mother, Lenna, saved his life when she scraped together enough money

119
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,120
 to send him to Oakland Academy, a small boarding school for boys in upstate New York.

120
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,080
 He hadn't been back there for 20 years and was surprised to see his old school being

121
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,600
 converted into condominiums.

122
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
 Man, it looks so little now.

123
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 My God.

124
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,919
 Denzel was 14 when he came here, one of only a handful of African American students.

125
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,120
 How did you end up here?

126
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,240
 I was in a public school, my mother in high school.

127
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,200
 And my mother decided it was best to get me out of there before I ended up where a lot

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,719
 of my friends are now in the grave, in the penitentiary.

129
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,719
 How were you up here?

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,720
 I mean, were you a bad kid?

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 No.

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 No.

133
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,960
 Angrier as time went along.

134
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
 What were you angry about?

135
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,640
 Come on, let's take a walk in here.

136
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,600
 Right about here was a chair.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,040
 And I was sitting in the messelor, whatever we called it.

138
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,880
 And they told me, your mother's here.

139
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
 And I said, my mother's here.

140
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
 I said, oh, what did I do?

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,840
 I did something wrong.

142
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,440
 And I came right about here, sat down.

143
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,200
 And she said, your father and I aren't together anymore.

144
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
 You're going to be with me.

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,080
 You know, I don't know what I'm going to do, but we're going to work it out.

146
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,080
 So this is where I found out my parents were getting divorced, right here, right here,

147
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
 right here, right here.

148
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,200
 I remember it like it was yesterday.

149
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,000
 So to answer your question about anger, I think I started getting a little trouble after

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,680
 that, started getting in fights.

151
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,840
 And I almost kicked out of school, but his mother talked the headmaster into giving

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
 him another chance.

153
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
 You owe her a lot.

154
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
 I owe her everything.

155
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,400
 I assume you told her that.

156
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,920
 In many ways.

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:18,360
 The story will continue after this.

158
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,600
 And so I made the most of that second chance, building a career that has brought him riches,

159
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,880
 fame and critical acclaim.

160
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,080
 So why would an actor who makes millions for one movie risk his reputation by taking a

161
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,039
 role that pays $1,700 a week?

162
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,039
 What do you get out of it?

163
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,480
 I mean, when you go through this performance, eight times a week.

164
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,280
 It's like retooling.

165
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,520
 The lights come up, the curtain goes up, and it's an actor's medium on stage.

166
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,800
 And you know, it's flying by the seat of your pants.

167
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 You got to keep going.

168
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
 It's live.

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
 Things happen.

170
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 We're still going through things.

171
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
 Things fall.

172
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 Lights don't work.

173
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
 You forget lines or whatever happens.

174
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
 And that's good.

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
 That's good exercise.

176
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 Cell phones go off.

177
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 Cell phones go off.

178
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,319
 One of these days, I'm going to respond to it in Iambic pentameter.

179
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,319
 Answer it that.

180
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,319
 My lord.

181
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:15,160
 My lord, it is for you.

182
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,680
 I'm going to be a man.

183
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,760
 This production has traded ancient rooms, togas and tunics for suits, ties, and camouflage.

184
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,839
 It is set in modern times and is intended to be evocative of power struggles in cities

185
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,400
 like Washington or Baghdad.

186
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,600
 What makes the play Julius Caesar relevant today?

187
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 Well, okay.

188
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,520
 I mean, it's what ifs.

189
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,800
 We do have leaders in the world that think they're gods.

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,680
 I mean, it's not just governments.

191
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
 It's corporations.

192
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,160
 It's, you know, unfortunately, not a lot has changed.

193
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,359
 I think it's a part of the human condition.

194
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,640
 Julius Caesar opened two weeks ago to mixed reviews.

195
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,199
 But Denzel says reviews don't affect him because he doesn't read them.

196
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:08,079
 Anyway, the show is nearly sold out for his scheduled 112 performances that will run

197
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,079
 until June.

198
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,359
 Performances that give him something he doesn't get in Hollywood.

199
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,600
 What do you feel at the end of a performance?

200
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,160
 I mean, this is not an easy role.

201
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
 Thankful.

202
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,480
 You know, I run off stage or wipe the makeup off.

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,040
 I say a quick prayer.

204
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,760
 I hear the people out there clap and you get a sense.

205
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 Is it two bows tonight?

206
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
 Is it one?

207
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 Is it three?

208
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 You know?

209
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,800
 But a relief, you know?

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
 Joy?

211
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,359
 You don't get that in the movies.

212
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,359
 Making movies.

213
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:49,880
 All the feelings I'm getting night after night, I mean, people are like, man, you got 100

214
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,199
 to go, but I'm like, yeah, I'm enjoying every one of them.
