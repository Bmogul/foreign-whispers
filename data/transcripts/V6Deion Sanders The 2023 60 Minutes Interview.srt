1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
 Conventionally, 60 minutes doesn't profile the same subject twice in two seasons, but

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,400
 convention doesn't intersect with Pro Football Hall of Famer D on Sanders.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,000
 Last fall, we met Sanders and Mississippi, where he was coaching Jackson State to prominence

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 in a conference of historically black colleges and universities.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,320
 Then, the man who calls himself Coach Prime, high-stepped it to Boulder to the University

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,920
 of Colorado, taking his blazingly singular style with him.

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,160
 There, he hasn't just awoken a dormant program, but has transformed it into the talk of

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,600
 College Football, if not American sports.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,160
 Sanders is revered, he is reviled, but his sudden impact is indisputable.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,519
 For the second time, into radically different environments, unapologetic as ever, he's

11
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:57,320
 shaken the sport like a snow globe.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,760
 The story will continue in a moment.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,040
 Are you the change agent or you the ultimate change agent?

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,520
 I make a difference.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,240
 I truly make a difference.

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,360
 I make folks nervous, man.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
 I get folks moving and they see it.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
 I get folks twilling their thumbs.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,600
 I get them thinking and second guessing they self.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,920
 You know, have you ever been so clean that you walked in and somebody looked down at

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,240
 you and they looked at themselves?

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,000
 They had to check themselves because you were so clean?

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,400
 I have that effect.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,400
 That was some good game right there, but God, that was good.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
 We ain't got next.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,400
 We ain't coming no more.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 We ain't coming no more.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,400
 We ain't coming no more.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,400
 This was the scene in the locker room two weekends ago.

30
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,400
 Give me my theme music.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,320
 Before the Colorado Buffaloes and their new coach, Dion Sanders, opened the season a 21-point

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,400
 underdog at TCU.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
 Colorado was fresh off a 1-11 season.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,560
 TCU was fresh from playing in last season's national championship game.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,200
 The skill and will, the Buffaloes 1-45-42, behind their star quarterback, Shadour Sanders.

36
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,800
 But the real focus, as ever, was on Shadour's 56-year-old father.

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
 It was his first win as coach of a power five school, the highest level of college football.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
 Do you feel like you were underestimated?

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,960
 You come here and it's, I don't know if coach prime can win.

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,120
 You must have heard what some of these other coaches were saying both secretly in the

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
 round.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
 That's fear.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
 Fear.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
 Yeah, that's fear.

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
 Yeah, sure.

46
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,760
 We don't want that engine that could get going because if that engine that could get

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,640
 going, he's going to start saying, I think I can.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
 I think I can.

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,600
 As soon as the lady, he's going to start saying, I know I can.

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
 I know I can.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,480
 Then soon the lady, he's going to start saying, I did that.

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,920
 His Colorado debut grew national attention and monster TV ratings.

53
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,680
 Interest compounded last weekend when the Buffaloes played before the biggest home crowd

54
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,320
 in 15 years in beat Ryvan Nebraska.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,920
 This weekend both Fox, India's PN dispatched their pregame shows, the rock included to

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
 Boulder.

57
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,600
 Then the Buffaloes rallied late to beat Colorado State in a double overtime thriller.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,200
 Three games into the season, the foothills of the Rockies marked the unlikely epicenter

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
 of an entire sport.

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
 What's this been like for you?

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,000
 It's been a lot of fun.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,560
 Rick George, who hired Coach Prime, has been Colorado's athletic director for a decade.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,480
 It's great for us to be able to bring this program back to relevancy and we had failed

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,600
 in my previous nine years, ten years.

65
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,800
 Fair to call this bit of a hell marry.

66
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,600
 It wasn't a hell marry, but it was a moment in time for our university and our athletic

67
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,920
 department that we were either going to be relevant or we were going to be irrelevant.

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:13,119
 It's too early to quantify the full prime effect, but merchandise sales up 819 percent from

69
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,720
 last season.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,760
 Instagram followers up more than tenfold season tickets sold out.

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,360
 Sanders might be the ideal coach for these shifting times in college football.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,599
 Another son, Dion Jr., is part of the Army of videographers filming the team nonstop

73
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,599
 for YouTube and an upcoming docu series.

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,520
 It's team one one game last season.

75
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,160
 Is that in a way a point of appeal?

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
 God wouldn't relocate me to something that was successful.

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,160
 That don't make sense to it.

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:53,520
 He had to find the most disappointing and the most difficult task.

79
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
 And this is what it was.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,560
 And this is what it is.

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
 And I love that.

82
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,440
 This wasn't dissimilar to what he told us last year.

83
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,360
 That God had called him collect to come to Jackson State University and elevate, yes, the

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,960
 football program, but also all HBCUs.

85
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,080
 He stayed three seasons, but the same night last December that JSU won the conference championship.

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,280
 Sanders announced he was off to Colorado to climb another mountain.

87
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,360
 You left Jackson State and you left quick.

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,880
 What did he tell those kids?

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
 I didn't leave quick.

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
 Let's laugh around.

91
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 I didn't leave quick.

92
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,000
 I left when I was supposed to leave.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
 We finished.

94
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
 Most coaches get a new job and they leave expeditiously.

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
 I finished the task.

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
 You say finished the task?

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,360
 Was there more work you could have done in Jackson or?

98
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,760
 I think we did a tremendous job in Jackson.

99
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,600
 I think we laid down a tremendous blueprint.

100
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,120
 We tried to press Sanders on the circumstances surrounding his abandoning the mission at

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
 Jackson State.

102
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,440
 He's hinted the school's lack of forward thinking may have factored in his decision.

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,039
 But on this topic, he was about as elusive as he was returning puns for touchdowns in

104
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,039
 the NFL.

105
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,560
 What did you tell us kids when you left?

106
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
 Opportunity.

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
 Call.

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,960
 Soon and later in life, there will be opportunity that knocks at your door.

109
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,919
 And at this juncture in my life, I felt like the opportunity for not only me, but for

110
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,919
 my kids as well, was tremendous.

111
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:28,560
 Not only did we take several kids from that team, three trainers, maybe 12 to 14 staffers,

112
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,760
 so we afforded to give people a tremendous opportunity here.

113
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,120
 The distance between Jackson and Boulder is a thousand miles and immeasurably further

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
 culturally.

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,000
 Sanders went from a city that is 83 percent black to one that is 1 percent black.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,420
 From a place with a water crisis to the kind of hipster college town where there is a

117
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,120
 shop devoted to kites.

118
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,840
 What are your first impressions?

119
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
 Beautiful.

120
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 Unbelievable.

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,240
 Just a whole piece of serenity of it all.

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
 I never fathom coming.

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,800
 I ain't never even vacation here, man.

124
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,560
 I ain't never been skiing or whatever you call it.

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,480
 Snowboarding or whatever all of stuff.

126
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,120
 You know, I ain't never done none of that.

127
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
 You don't even fly fish.

128
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
 No, I don't.

129
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
 I fish.

130
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,719
 I'm flyy-why-fish, but I don't fly fish.

131
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:23,200
 Still, he wasted no time ingratiating himself in the community, including a visit to Peggy

132
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,960
 Coppum, a 98 year old Buffalo superfan.

133
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
 Are you prime?

134
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
 Do I call you Xander?

135
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
 No, I call me Xander.

136
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 Yeah.

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
 How about good looking?

138
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
 That'll do.

139
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
 Okay.

140
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,159
 He was less embracing of the incumbent Colorado players.

141
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,240
 But the first team meeting in December, Sanders encouraged players to enter the transfer portal,

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,480
 an open market for athletes to find new schools.

143
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,720
 I promise you it's my job to get rid of them.

144
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,640
 And make room for superior talent he planned to bring in.

145
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,280
 More than 50 players eventually transferred out.

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
 You got here and you didn't pull punches.

147
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,880
 You told some of these guys.

148
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,400
 You take a team that's won one game and you fired a whole coaching staff.

149
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
 So who did the coaching staff recruit?

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,719
 The kids.

151
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:17,479
 So the kids are just as much to blame as the coaching staff.

152
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,320
 And I came to the conclusion that a multitude of them can help us get to where we wanted to go.

153
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
 You told most of these guys.

154
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,599
 The more you jump in, the more room you're going to make.

155
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,159
 Those of you we don't run off, we're going to try to make you quit.

156
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:31,599
 You made it very clear.

157
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,600
 Yeah.

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,560
 If you went for that, if you were able to let words run you off, you ain't for us because

159
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,960
 we're old school staff.

160
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
 We coach hard.

161
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
 We coach tough.

162
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
 We're discipline.

163
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
 Narians.

164
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:49,120
 So if you're allowing the verbiage to run you off because you don't feel secure with

165
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,160
 your ability, you ain't for us.

166
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
 If some kids said you know what, no, I'm staying.

167
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
 You're not going to run me off with your words.

168
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
 Right.

169
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
 Stay.

170
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
 So prove it.

171
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,440
 I'm sure that your straight talk was appreciated by some.

172
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,640
 But is this scorched earth policy good for college football or for the kids?

173
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,800
 I think truth is good for kids.

174
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
 We're so busy line.

175
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,080
 We don't even recognize the truth no more in society.

176
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,760
 We want everybody to feel good.

177
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
 That's not the way life is.

178
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,520
 Now it is my job to make sure I have what we need to win.

179
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,000
 That makes a lot of people feel good winning does.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
 I got to push back on this.

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,040
 You're a father of college athletes.

182
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
 Yes.

183
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
 If they called you and say, hey, we got a new coach and they're telling me to get in

184
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
 the transfer portal.

185
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,840
 As a son, you must not be doing well.

186
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
 That's what you said.

187
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,360
 You must not be doing well because you should be an asset and not a liability.

188
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,160
 I'm honest with my kids.

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,040
 His kids include Shadour, the star quarterback, in Shiloh, a starting safety.

190
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,000
 You guys have any idea that you were going to be this good and capture the country the

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 way you have?

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Yeah.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You did.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,600
 We both didn't come here have our dad coaching just to lose.

195
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,000
 A year ago to the day, we watched Shadour fling and zing touchdown passes at Jackson State.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,200
 But there were questions about whether he could do the same against stiffer competition.

197
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,040
 Well, in his first two games at Colorado, he threw for nearly 1,000 yards without an

198
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
 interception.

199
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,560
 If you're putting up big numbers at Jackson State, you're doing it here against teams in

200
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
 the big 10, big 12.

201
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,560
 Yeah.

202
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
 And you're gratifying.

203
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,199
 Yeah, now these two games was the most yards I passed for my career.

204
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:38,400
 So it's just exciting knowing that it's translating and I got on the bigger stage.

205
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,640
 I just feel better.

206
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,199
 He's also, and again, welcome to today's college sports, translated his success into riches

207
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,800
 thanks to NIL, named Image likeness income.

208
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,000
 So much so, he drives a $190,000 Mercedes Maybach.

209
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 And Shadour might not even be the team's best player.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Travis Hunter also followed Coach Prime from Jackson to Colorado.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,400
 His coach lets him play offense in deepness, virtually unheard of in a modern college game.

212
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,680
 You've got two really good Heisman quality players on this team.

213
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
 Yes.

214
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
 Your son and Travis Hunter.

215
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
 Yes, sir.

216
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,320
 First half of the first game of the season, you're already publicly talking about Travis

217
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,000
 Hunter's Heisman chances.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Who does that?

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,280
 A coach that loves his kids.

220
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,960
 The coach that understands that's what those kids desire.

221
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,640
 And I suppose to do that.

222
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,880
 That's what we told them when they were coming and choosing to play for us.

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,400
 My kids that play for me, they didn't choose a university.

224
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,880
 They chose me.

225
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,520
 That's the difference.

226
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,320
 Coaches have chosen to join Sanders as well.

227
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,800
 The staff he overhauled and upgraded includes former head coaches and former coordinators

228
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 from schools like Alabama.

229
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 Now that you're a power five guy, who's the best coach in college football today?

230
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,359
 Let me see a mirror so I can look at it.

231
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,359
 You feel that?

232
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,199
 You think I'm going to sit up here and tell you somebody else.

233
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:10,959
 You think that's the way I operate.

234
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,920
 That's somebody else got that on me.

235
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,680
 But I tell you this.

236
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,319
 I love and adore and I respect.

237
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:25,359
 And every time I do a commercial with Coach Sabin, it's a gift.

238
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:30,120
 Just sitting in his presence and hearing him and throwing something else out there so I

239
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,280
 could hear his viewpoint on it because he's forgotten more things than I may ever accomplish.

240
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:44,560
 So I'm a student looking up to this wonderful teacher saying, just throw me a crumb

241
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,599
 of what you know.

242
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:51,760
 For all the bling and bluster, there is some humility and the current mania may die down

243
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,680
 a bit as Colorado faces a welter of tougher opponents the rest of the season.

244
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,119
 But Deon Sanders has invigorated a campus, a program, an entire sport.

245
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:06,119
 Game ball, Peggy.

246
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,719
 And damn if he hasn't made it fun.

247
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,960
 Give me my team music.
