1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
 Rich Paul has become one of the premier agents in professional sports.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,000
 He counts LeBron James as a close friend and client.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,360
 The agency he founded, Clutch Sports Group, made deals worth almost $900 million this past

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,400
 summer for his NBA clients alone.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,040
 Paul honed his deal-making instincts as a kid, navigating what he called the hostile streets

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,080
 of his Cleveland neighborhood.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,620
 Today at 42, he's rewriting the playbook for representing pro athletes.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,400
 Rich Paul told us he was lucky, and when you hear his story, we think you'll understand

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,160
 why.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,400
 The story will continue in a moment.

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,879
 So the juice to come to game is when you were younger?

12
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,160
 I went one time when I had to sit all the way up at the top and you really couldn't

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,400
 see the person.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
 Now?

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 Now it's now.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,239
 You're sitting on the floor.

17
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,039
 We joined Rich Paul court side at a Cleveland Cavaliers game last season.

18
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:13,680
 He seemed to know everyone.

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:22,160
 And it seemed everyone wanted to know him.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:29,200
 Last year, Paul got Cleveland star Darius Garland, a $200 million deal, the richest in franchise

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
 history.

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,360
 Garland is one of nearly 200 athletes on Paul's roster.

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,320
 Who were some of the big names that we would all recognize?

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 Which sport you want?

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,600
 I mean, we just had Janet Hertz and Devonte Smith playing Super Bowl for the Philadelphia

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 Eagles.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,440
 And then you got Anthony Davis' and Dre Monde Green's and obviously LeBron.

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,640
 Do you know the total value of the contract you negotiated?

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
 I would say it's close to $3 billion, I think.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,040
 It's more than $4 billion, but it's hard to keep track when you're always on the go.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
 Showtime, baby.

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,640
 Before the NBA draft in New York City, we watched him work the phones.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,280
 You know, it's draft day, man.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
 Anything can happen.

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
 Work the room.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
 Hey, Coach, how you doing?

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
 How you doing?

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
 All right?

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,680
 And work the angles to move clients like Duke Center, Derek Lively II, up the draft

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
 board.

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,640
 In college, Lively was known for his defense, but Paul had him work on his three-point shot.

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,440
 And before the draft, invited teams to see.

43
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,080
 Lively shot up to the twelfth pick about 10 spots higher than first projected.

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,040
 It might not look like it, but Rich Paul is a towering figure in the NBA.

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,679
 I've always been the smallest guy in the room.

46
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,120
 We're in the take the biggest swing.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,959
 Some of his biggest swings have been for his biggest client, LeBron James.

48
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:04,239
 Paul negotiated his jumps from Miami to Cleveland to LA, deals that netted James $400 million

49
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,519
 and set him up to win two of his four championships.

50
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,359
 He told us he works to give players leverage.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,640
 Some people say that you're destroying the player loyalty to the teams and the fans.

52
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,120
 Player loyalty to what?

53
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:28,200
 If I could be traded in the middle of the night to another team, what I should be is educating

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,440
 myself to where if this isn't going the way I thought it was supposed to go, I can switch

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
 up.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 Right?

57
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
 We're not in the options.

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 I have options.

59
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,080
 What's the system having money with no options?

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
 It's apparently how superstar Anthony Davis felt in 2018.

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,840
 The New Orleans Center had a $127 million contract but was tired of losing.

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,920
 So he fired his agent and hired Rich Paul.

63
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,640
 Paul flouted NBA rules by publicly demanding a trade, earning the wrath of fans and a $50,000

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,240
 fine for Davis.

65
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:12,060
 The drama landed Paul on the cover of Sports Illustrated, which called him the most polarizing

66
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,220
 figure in the NBA.

67
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,140
 When it was someone that didn't look like me, it was genius.

68
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,260
 It was why you get a power agent.

69
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,420
 But when it's me, I'm destroying the league.

70
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,100
 I mean, those things are absurd.

71
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,780
 He got Davis what he wanted, a championship ring, and a deal now worth $270 million.

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,179
 There's a saying that goes, if you ain't got no haters, you ain't popping.

73
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:44,380
 So you must be popping.

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,419
 I think I'm popping a little bit, you know.

75
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,700
 He was popping a lot at his annual All Star Game Party this past winter in Salt Lake City.

76
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,500
 We dropped in and saw a giants of the court mingling with rappers, team owners, and titans

77
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,859
 of industry over cocktails and canopies.

78
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:12,860
 Rich Paul had a full plate of business options, one from the president of Gatorade.

79
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,060
 While we were chatting with him, Golden State Warrior, Dremon Green, cut in.

80
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,100
 The four-time NBA champion cycled through two other agents before signing up with Rich

81
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,620
 Paul, who landed him a $100 million contract over the summer.

82
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,140
 So then you end up a young black man who's made more money than you can ever imagine,

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,860
 but you don't know how to live with it.

84
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,540
 You don't know what to do with it.

85
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,020
 And what does he do?

86
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,100
 Most agents treat athletes as if the athlete worked for them.

87
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,940
 But there's a multi-billion dollar business going on around most athletes that they don't

88
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,060
 understand, but they don't have a rich part of the teacher.

89
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,900
 And that's what's special about them.

90
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,220
 Paul's improbable journey, the subject of his new memoir out this week, started on the

91
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,660
 east side of Cleveland in the early 1980s, just as crack cocaine hit the streets.

92
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,740
 When he was about four, he learned his mother Minerva was hooked on crack.

93
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,460
 His father, Big Rich, recognized his son's intelligence and kept him close, though they

94
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,020
 lived apart.

95
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,420
 He owned the neighborhood convenience store.

96
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,020
 It's your dad's store, just right in here.

97
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
 Yeah.

98
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,300
 And this was my world.

99
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,300
 This now empty corner was a hotbed of activity, legal and illegal.

100
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,340
 It was a shootout right here in this corner.

101
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,380
 Big Rich taught his son to always think two steps ahead.

102
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,540
 He scraped together the money to send him to a Catholic high school away from the neighborhood.

103
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,580
 Still, there was no avoiding the streets.

104
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,380
 You don't know what you're in.

105
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,380
 That's your norm.

106
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,580
 That's my norm.

107
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,860
 Sardines, Dr. Kahn, that was today's version of Tuna Tartar on the wall.

108
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,300
 The door of rooftop.

109
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,620
 This was my education, though.

110
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,900
 This was my Harvard, my Michigan, my more house.

111
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,460
 And the same things I learned on this corner, I take it to the boardroom.

112
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,780
 Because the one thing this teaches you that I don't think you can learn from those institutions

113
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,380
 is people, characters.

114
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,820
 And on these streets, it's no better way to learn character because they're coming

115
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,140
 with everything.

116
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:31,060
 His dad taught him another skill, a way to make money if all else fails with a pair of dice.

117
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,580
 Paul and his best friend Edward Gibbons were regulars at an open-air casino in the park.

118
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,180
 Fifty people crowded around this little area and the energy was high.

119
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,460
 It was an arena.

120
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,820
 And Rich Paul was a natural.

121
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,700
 And how much would you earn?

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,460
 I mean, a slow day was $1,000.

123
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,060
 And not slow day?

124
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,780
 You know, four or five.

125
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,420
 Four or five thousand dollars.

126
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
 Yeah.

127
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
 What year were you 14, 15, 16?

128
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
 Oh, yeah.

129
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,620
 What did you learn from this experience?

130
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,700
 You gained a resilience here.

131
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,100
 We won majority of the time.

132
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,300
 But you also had to learn how to lose.

133
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,420
 He suffered his biggest loss when he was 19.

134
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,780
 His father died from cancer.

135
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,780
 And Paul went all in on the streets, selling marijuana and crack cocaine.

136
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,700
 This is the very drug that your mother was hooked on.

137
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,659
 The absence of my dad allowed me to take that step

138
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:39,100
 because I would have never done that had he been around.

139
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,819
 I had too much respect for him.

140
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:45,579
 If it was not something that I would sit here and glorify.

141
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,900
 It almost sounds like you were full-time hustler.

142
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,939
 Oh, yeah.

143
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,140
 But Jeff Bezos is a hustler.

144
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,820
 I think he's not.

145
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,420
 Phil Knight was the ultimate hustler.

146
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:06,720
 The difference is they could go with their plan and their business idea and get someone

147
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,380
 to believe in them.

148
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,740
 It didn't matter what idea I had.

149
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,940
 Just no path way to get there.

150
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,380
 He found one through a stroke of luck.

151
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,540
 At the Akron Canton Airport in 2001, Paul was wearing a throwback jersey like this one

152
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,980
 that caught the eye of another traveler.

153
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,939
 High school hoop sensation, LeBron James.

154
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:28,939
 What did you see in him?

155
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:34,420
 I began with him, you know, wearing a throwback jersey that I loved.

156
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,660
 But as we got to talking about sports, we started evolving and even talking more and

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,940
 more just about life and about upbringing, about our moms and our communities and stuff

158
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,900
 of that nature and it just kind of struck a core.

159
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,980
 When James entered the NBA, he hired Rich Paul as a right-hand man.

160
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,740
 Paul went on to work for LeBron's agent and watched, listened and learned.

161
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,460
 I understand that you would go into meetings with the likes of Warren Buffett.

162
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:13,060
 Being in those rooms is much better to listen than to talk.

163
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,700
 If you listen, you might actually learn something and you start to kind of, you know, work your

164
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,220
 way on your own.

165
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:28,820
 After just four years, he struck out on his own and launched Clutch Sports Group in 2012,

166
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,860
 LeBron James went with him.

167
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,180
 When you first started this, you were underestimated.

168
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,020
 Not only was I underestimated, I was also not wanted.

169
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,620
 I didn't look like the success in our industry, especially from a place of decision-making.

170
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,939
 And I wanted to disrupt the industry.

171
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:51,380
 I wanted to be impactful, but I wanted to come from a place of purpose.

172
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,540
 In 2013, with his first negotiation as agent for Phoenix Sun's Guard, Eric Bledso, he proved

173
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,339
 the naysayers wrong.

174
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,260
 He said the Suns had offered $28 million.

175
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,979
 And then $48 million.

176
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,260
 You turned it down?

177
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
 Yeah.

178
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,780
 But what was on the line?

179
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,020
 My career?

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,620
 Everyone was calling and saying he's crazy.

181
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,780
 He don't know what he's doing.

182
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
 He's inexperienced.

183
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,100
 It sounds like you are really comfortable rolling the dice.

184
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,060
 I was born a dice roller.

185
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,020
 His gamble paid off.

186
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,660
 After hanging tough for a year, Clutch got Bledso a $70 million deal.

187
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,300
 $42 million more than the Suns' first offer.

188
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,300
 Great room.

189
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:42,300
 Today, Clutch has 70 employees with offices in Los Angeles, New York, and Atlanta.

190
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,980
 And they've opened the same draft class.

191
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,219
 Paul teamed up with Powerhouse Agency, UTA, to expand Clutch's reach.

192
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:59,420
 I had to build a multi-hundred million dollar company to get people to believe in me.

193
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,860
 And they're still doubt.

194
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,660
 Critics say he's only successful because of his relationship with you.

195
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,300
 I mean, is disappointing to hear that.

196
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,060
 Would you give him an opportunity?

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,220
 Yeah, and I don't give people an opportunity much.

198
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,620
 And he took way beyond what he even imagined.

199
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,780
 Rich Paul now has a new balance signature shoe, a first for an agent.

200
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,300
 His partner is more famous than he is.

201
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,980
 He's been in a relationship with Adele for two and a half years.

202
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,220
 She gave him a shout out at the Grammys.

203
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,780
 Oh, God, Rich, he took his hit.

204
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
 Don't cry.

205
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,300
 If you win, you think tonight don't cry.

206
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,780
 And here I am crying.

207
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:45,260
 A couple of weeks later at his All-Star Game Party, Paul's friends recognized his achievements.

208
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,740
 With a $140,000 watch.

209
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,540
 Wow.

210
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,540
 Wow.

211
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,540
 Wow.

212
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,700
 Do you have to pinch yourself sometimes?

213
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,700
 All the time.

214
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
 I had it worse than a lot of people.

215
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,700
 But I evolved.

216
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,420
 I mature, I transition.

217
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,660
 How does that feel?

218
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,620
 Feels great.

219
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,940
 It feels earned.

220
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
 You know?

221
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,740
 It wasn't given for sure.

222
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,940
 It was earned, which is good.

223
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,460
 I like that.
