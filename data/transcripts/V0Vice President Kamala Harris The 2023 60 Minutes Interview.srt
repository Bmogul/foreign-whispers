1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
 Israel has begun what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls the second stage of the war

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,520
 by expanding its military ground operations in Gaza.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,320
 We spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris this past week, as the Biden administration

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,080
 was trying to balance Israel's need to retaliate against Hamas with the urgent need to get

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,000
 relief to the Palestinian people.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,760
 Vice President Harris told us she is also involved in the administration's efforts on the

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,400
 war in Ukraine, as well as countless intractable problems, including gun violence at home.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,200
 But with the Middle East on a razor's edge, we started our conversation there.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,560
 The story will continue in a moment.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,680
 How close is this to becoming a regional conflict that could draw in U.S. troops?

11
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:02,640
 We have absolutely no intention, nor do we have any plans to send combat troops into

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,400
 Israel or Gaza, period.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,240
 Vice President Harris told us the U.S. is not telling Israel what to do, but is providing

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,960
 advice, equipment, and diplomatic support.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:22,520
 A terrorist organization, Hamas, slaughtered hundreds of young people at a concert by most

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,399
 estimates at least 1,400 Israelis are dead.

17
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:31,280
 Israel without any question has a right to defend itself.

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,320
 That being said, it is very important that there be no conflation between Hamas and the

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,880
 Palestinians.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:48,840
 The Palestinians deserve equal measures of safety and security, self-determination and dignity,

21
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,040
 and we have been very clear that the rules of war must be adhered to, and that there

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,680
 be humanitarian aid that flows.

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,640
 She told us the U.S. wants to keep the conflict from escalating, but that's proving difficult.

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,880
 In the last two weeks, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, both proxies of Iran

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,840
 have launched missiles, rockets, and drones against Israel.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,000
 And Iranian-backed militias have fired on U.S. troops stationed in Iraq and Syria.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,240
 In response, the U.S. launched airstrikes against Iranian weapons facilities in Syria.

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,000
 If that weren't enough of a signal to Iran and other adversaries, the Pentagon has also

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,880
 deployed two imposing aircraft carrier strike groups to the region.

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,920
 And what's the message to Iran?

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
 Don't.

32
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,360
 As President Biden said, just don't.

33
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
 Exactly.

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
 One word.

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 Pretty straightforward.

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,760
 Since the Hamas attack on Israel, the Vice President says she has spoken with President Isaac

37
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,000
 Herzog of Israel and joined President Biden on calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,160
 and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,840
 President Joe Biden told us in a statement, this is as high stakes and complex a situation

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,120
 as it gets, and Kamala is my partner in all of it.

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,280
 He told us Harris' advice and counsel are invaluable.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,680
 When he was Vice President, Mr. Biden famously said that he wanted to be the last person

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,080
 in the room with President Obama.

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,800
 Do you have that relationship with President Biden?

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 I do.

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 You do.

47
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 I do.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,680
 And I take that responsibility quite seriously.

49
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,600
 How often do you meet with him?

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,360
 Multiple times a day, quite often unless he or I are traveling.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,200
 They're in total agreement the U.S. must stand with Israel and Ukraine to democracies

52
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,920
 under attack.

53
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:03,560
 We are as committed to Ukraine as we've always been, to authorize additional aid, to defend

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,000
 itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,800
 That is not going to waver.

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,920
 Because this war in the Middle East put Ukraine on a back burner.

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
 Not for us.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 No, it does not.

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,920
 Put them on a back burner at all.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,000
 Vice President Harris has visited 19 countries and met with more than 100 world leaders.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,480
 But lately, she has been the administration's point person on domestic priorities, traveling

62
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,360
 the country talking up the Democrats' key issues before the 2024 election.

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,920
 Those she hopes will fire up the base but are bound to inflame the GOP.

64
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,200
 She went to North Carolina to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe V Wade.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,080
 How dare they attack our fundamental rights.

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,040
 How dare they attack our freedom.

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,120
 In Virginia, it was guns.

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,000
 Our nation is being torn apart by gun violence.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,160
 We joined the Vice President and Second Gentlemen Doug M. Hoff on Air Force 2 for a trip to Las Vegas.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,240
 It was five days after the terror attack on Israel.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,240
 Welcome aboard.

72
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
 Welcome aboard.

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
 Welcome aboard.

74
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,240
 While in the air, the Vice President joined a secure video call with the President and

75
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,360
 their national security teams to discuss measures to keep the homeland safe.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,080
 Once on the ground in Las Vegas, Vice President Harris went to the College of Southern Nevada,

77
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 the eighth stop on her fight for our Freedom College tour.

78
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 Because you voted, Joe Biden is President of the United States and I am Vice President

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
 of the United States.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
 Because you voted.

81
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,360
 But nationally, the Biden Harris administration is not generating the kind of enthusiasm she's

82
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,440
 seeing on her tour.

83
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:06,360
 A recent CBS poll found that at the beginning of President Biden's term, 70% of young people,

84
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,520
 people under 30, said he was doing a good job.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
 Now it's less than 50%.

86
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
 Why is that?

87
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,520
 What's going on?

88
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,840
 If you pull how young people feel about the climate and the warming of our planet, it

89
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,159
 pulls as one of their top concerns when we talk about what we are doing with student

90
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
 alone debt.

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,320
 It pulls very high.

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,280
 The challenge that we have as an administration is we got to let people know who brought it

93
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
 to them.

94
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,080
 That's our challenge.

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,920
 But it is not that the work we are doing is not very, very popular with a lot of people.

96
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,680
 She blames the disconnect in part on lack of media coverage.

97
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,360
 Still, the Vice President herself is not very popular now.

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,760
 At 41% of adults told CBS News they approve of the job she's doing, about the same for

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,520
 President Biden.

100
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,120
 We talked to her the day before the carnage in Maine, but she had told us issues like mass

101
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,360
 shootings are more important than poll numbers.

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,080
 You have a portfolio that includes gun violence, the root cause of migration.

103
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,200
 These are some of the most intractable issues facing the country.

104
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,680
 We've done some of the most significant gun safety laws in 30 years, but we still need

105
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
 an assault weapons ban.

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
 It doesn't have to be this way.

107
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,800
 There wasn't assault weapons ban at one time.

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 It expired.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,480
 Let's renew it.

110
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,440
 Most Americans say that they don't think you're doing a good job on the border.

111
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,039
 You and the administration.

112
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,360
 The number of people trying to cross the U.S. southern border is at an all time high.

113
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,600
 It's no secret that we have a broken immigration system.

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 Short term, we need a safe, orderly, and humane border policy.

115
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,880
 And long term, we need to invest in the root causes of migration.

116
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,800
 But the bottom line, Congress needs to act.

117
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,040
 Come on, participate in the solution instead of political gamesmanship.

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,040
 If politics is a game, Kamala Harris has proven herself to be a savvy player, forging

119
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,480
 a career that has gone from one first to another.

120
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,760
 The child of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, she was the first woman district attorney

121
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,440
 for San Francisco.

122
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,880
 The first woman to serve as California's attorney general.

123
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,960
 The first woman of color elected senator from California.

124
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
 So, how can we go?

125
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:42,440
 And the first woman and woman of color to be elected vice president of the United States.

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,040
 Being in that unique position, being that first.

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
 Yeah.

128
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
 Is that bringing added pressure?

129
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 No doubt.

130
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
 No doubt.

131
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,280
 You know, my mother, she would say, Kamala, you may be the first to do many things.

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,120
 Make sure you're not the last.

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:05,480
 And among the responsibilities that I carry and maybe impose on myself, that is one of them.

134
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,719
 So this was...

135
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:10,240
 She showed us around the vice president's ceremonial office.

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,280
 I brought in this bust of Thurgood Marshall.

137
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,600
 And I always have him over my right shoulder in the drawer here.

138
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,400
 The desk where previous vice presidents left their signatures.

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,720
 Al Gore, Quail, Cheney, Harry Truman.

140
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,160
 Some of these men went on to become president, but Kamala Harris told us she is focused on

141
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,280
 getting the Biden Harris ticket re-elected next year.

142
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,880
 The GOP is using her low poll numbers and president Biden's age as a battering ram.

143
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,880
 And some Democrats are growing worried.

144
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,520
 We were talking to some Democratic donors and they have told us that should something

145
00:09:52,520 --> 00:10:01,800
 before President Biden and he is not able to run, that there would be a free for all for

146
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 who would run as president.

147
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,000
 You are in the spot that that would be a natural for you to step up, but we're hearing from donors

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,920
 that they would not naturally fall into line.

149
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 Why is that?

150
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,960
 Well, first of all, I'm not going to engage in that hypothetical because Joe Biden is very

151
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,400
 much alive and running for re-election.

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,320
 But you do know, I mean that is a concern and a legitimate concern, I would say.

153
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,920
 I hear from a lot of different people, a lot of different things, but let me just tell

154
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,600
 you, I'm focused on the job.

155
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 A truly am.

156
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,920
 Our democracy is on the line, Bill.

157
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,840
 And I frankly, in my head, do not have time for parlor games when we have a president

158
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,920
 who is running for re-election.

159
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
 That's it.

160
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
 Joe Biden.

161
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,000
 Conventional wisdom is that most presidential elections are won or lost on the economy.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,040
 And while inflation has been coming down, prices for basics like food and shelter remain

163
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,280
 staggeringly high.

164
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,520
 We came into office during the height of a pandemic, record unemployment.

165
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,160
 And because of our economic policies, we now are reducing inflation.

166
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,079
 We have created over 14 million new jobs.

167
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,079
 We've created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.

168
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,360
 Wages are up.

169
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,040
 And so we've seen great progress.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,800
 Considering what you are laying out as your achievements, you have the current front

171
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,040
 runner for the GOP, Donald Trump, facing what 91 criminal charges.

172
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,640
 I've lost count.

173
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,839
 Yet the Biden-Harris ticket is running neck and neck with Donald Trump.

174
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,360
 Why are you not 30 points ahead?

175
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,599
 Well, I'm not a political punting.

176
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,480
 So I'm not going to speak to that, but what I will say is this.

177
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,880
 When the American people are able to take a close look at election time on their options,

178
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,160
 I think the choice is going to be clear.

179
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
 Bill, we're going to win.

180
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,520
 Let me just tell you that.

181
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,680
 We're going to win.

182
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
 And I'm not saying it's going to be easy, but we will win.

183
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,200
 You say that with such conviction.

184
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,680
 I have no doubt.

185
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
 But I also have no doubt.

186
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,080
 It's going to be a lot of work.

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,760
 And everyone's going to have to participate.

188
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
 This is a democracy.

189
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
 Democracy.

190
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,040
 She said that word often during our interview.

191
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,080
 Despite the criticism and low poll numbers, former prosecutor Kamala Harris told us she's

192
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,360
 prepared to trust the verdict of the American people.

193
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,880
 Do you have to ask yourself, why are people seeming not to hear our message?

194
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,400
 I look at it more as let's keep getting out there.

195
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,240
 And as with any election, we've got to make our case to the American people.

196
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
 That's part of our responsibility.

197
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
 And that's this process.

198
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,880
 And that's what it is.

199
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,040
 And that's a fair process.
