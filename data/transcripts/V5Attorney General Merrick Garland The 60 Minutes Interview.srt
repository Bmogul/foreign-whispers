1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,340
 Not since Watergate has an attorney general been at the center of such a firestorm, Merrick

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,060
 Garland's Justice Department is prosecuting both former President Trump and the son

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,219
 of President Biden.

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,700
 Caught in the middle is this 70-year-old former prosecutor and well-respected judge with

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,620
 a long history as a moderate.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,680
 We met Garland Friday in Washington.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,040
 He told us that he devoted his life to the rule of law because of his family's struggle

8
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,879
 to escape the Holocaust.

9
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,600
 Now, he's responsible for prosecutions that will shape the future of the nation.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,000
 In a rare interview, the attorney general told us that in the Trump and Biden trials ahead,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,440
 his prosecutors will pursue justice without fear and without favor.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,839
 The story will continue in a moment.

13
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:05,280
 We do not have one rule for Republicans and another rule for Democrats.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,920
 We don't have one rule for foes and another for friends.

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,120
 We don't have one rule for powerful and another for the powerless, for the richer, for the

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,759
 poor, based on ethnicity.

17
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,200
 We have only one rule and that one rule is that we follow the facts and the law and we reach

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,479
 the decisions required by the Constitution and we protect civil liberties.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,400
 Are you essentially saying, as attorney general, to the American people, trust me?

20
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,640
 Well, in the end, I suppose it does, in the end, come down to trust, but it's not just

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
 me.

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,240
 It's decades of the norms of this department that are part of the DNA of the career prosecutors

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,880
 who are running the investigation and supervising the investigations that you're talking about.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 Former President Trump faces two federal trials.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,160
 One for allegedly hoarding classified documents and covering it up.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,320
 The other for allegedly conspiring to seize power after the 2020 election.

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,799
 Attorney General Garland has said little about this and we wanted to understand why.

28
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:13,560
 Well, I think the first thing to understand is because these are pending cases, because

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,680
 there are two federal indictments, a long standing rule in the Justice Department is that

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,120
 we can't comment about pending cases.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
 What does that rule come from?

32
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
 What's the point?

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,800
 One reason is to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the person who's under investigation.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,440
 It's to protect witnesses who also may or may not become public later in an investigation.

35
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,920
 And then finally, it's to protect the investigation itself.

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,920
 Investigations proceed in many different directions, eventually coming to a fruition, a decision

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,920
 to charge or not charge, about a particular thing or not.

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,040
 And if witnesses and potential subjects knew everything that the investigators had previously

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,160
 looked at and were about to look at, it could well change testimony.

40
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,200
 It could well make witnesses unavailable to us.

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,160
 And this is not peculiar to the Trump investigations.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,959
 This is a rule for all investigations.

43
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,760
 This is part of what we call our Justice Manual.

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,600
 It's been there for probably at least 30 years and probably a bit longer than that.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,959
 Help us understand the timing.

46
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,560
 These prosecutions of the former president are happening during the campaign.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,960
 You could make the argument that it's the worst possible time.

48
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,720
 The Justice Department has general practices about not making significant over-steps or

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,200
 charging within a month or so of an election.

50
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
 We are clearly outside that timeframe.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,920
 In these cases, prosecutors, special counsel, they follow the facts.

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,640
 In the law where they lead, when they've gotten the amount of evidence necessary to make

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,640
 a charging decision and have decided that a charge is warranted, that's when they bring

54
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,920
 their cases.

55
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,720
 The investigation itself has determined the timing.

56
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,119
 Yes, exactly right.

57
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:09,480
 Your critics say that it's time to ruin Mr. Trump's chances in the election.

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,160
 Well, that's absolutely not true.

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,399
 Justice Department prosecutors are nonpartisan.

60
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,840
 They don't allow partisan considerations to play any role in their determinations.

61
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,760
 The prosecutor in the Trump cases is Jack Smith.

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,880
 He was named by Garland to be special counsel.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,280
 That's a job under the regulations of the Justice Department designed to give Smith broad

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
 independence from the department and from the White House.

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,720
 The most important aspect of the regulations is that the special counsel is not subject

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,040
 to the day-to-day supervision of anyone in the Justice Department.

67
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,880
 You are not in communication with the president or any member of his administration with regard

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,200
 to the investigation of former President Trump.

69
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,640
 No, I am not.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:05,240
 If President Biden asked you to take action with regard to the Trump investigation, what

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
 would your reaction be?

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,120
 I am sure that that will not happen, but I would not do anything in that regard.

73
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,560
 If necessary, I would resign.

74
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,640
 But there is no sense at anything like that will happen.

75
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,160
 Have you ever had to tell him, hands off, these investigations, Mr. President?

76
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,440
 No, because he has never tried to put hands on these investigations.

77
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,600
 Separately, President Biden himself is the subject of a special counsel investigation

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,080
 into whether he improperly held classified documents after he was vice president.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,280
 His son, Hunter Biden, is the target of a four-year investigation into his business deals

80
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,159
 and his taxes.

81
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:55,760
 He has been indicted for lying about drug abuse when he bought a gun.

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:03,479
 Republicans accuse special counsel David Weiss of slow-walking the Hunter Biden investigation.

83
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:10,960
 The allegation is, Mr. Attorney General, that what is described in some quarters

84
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,479
 as the Biden Justice Department is taking it easy on the president's son.

85
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,680
 Well, look, this investigation began under David Weiss.

86
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,159
 David Weiss, a long-standing career prosecutor, and he was appointed by Mr. Trump as the

87
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,400
 United States Attorney for the District of Delaware.

88
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,080
 I promised at my nomination hearing that I would continue him on in that position and that

89
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,799
 I would not interfere with this investigation.

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,400
 You are not participating in those decisions.

91
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,680
 No, Mr. Weiss is making those decisions.

92
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,880
 The White House is not attempting to influence those decisions.

93
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
 Absolutely not.

94
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,080
 And he said, we won't have to take his word for it.

95
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,760
 Under Justice Department regulations, a special counsel must write a final report.

96
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,080
 Which I will make public to the extent permissible under the law.

97
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,560
 It is required to explain their prosecuted decisions, their decisions to prosecute or

98
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,840
 not prosecute, and their strategic decisions along the way.

99
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,960
 Usually the special counsels have testified at the end of their reports, and I expect that

100
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,440
 that will be the case here.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,919
 How is your relationship with the president?

102
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,320
 It must be frosty.

103
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,400
 I have a good working relationship with the president.

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,200
 Good, perhaps, but maybe not close.

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,039
 The president addressed the question in August when he spotted Garland at a White House event.

106
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,240
 Attorney General Garland, haven't seen you in a long while.

107
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
 Good to see you.

108
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:50,680
 Secretary Obama, you think I'm kidding or not.

109
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:58,680
 Attorney General Garland leads 115,000 employees, prosecutors, agents of the FBI, and other

110
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,039
 federal law enforcement.

111
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,960
 Political security is now assigned to protect judges and prosecutors after the Trump cases

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,600
 drew death threats.

113
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,360
 Political violence is among Garland's greatest concerns.

114
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,640
 People can argue with each other as much as they want and as vociferously as they want.

115
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,960
 But the one thing they may not do is use violence and threats of violence to alter the outcome.

116
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,920
 An important aspect of this is the American people themselves.

117
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,320
 American people must protect each other.

118
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:45,520
 They must ensure that they treat each other with civility and kindness, listen to opposing

119
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
 views.

120
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,520
 Argue is vociferously as they want, but refrain from violence and threats of violence.

121
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,040
 That's the only way this democracy will survive.

122
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,400
 Why do you feel so strongly about that?

123
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,199
 Well I feel it for a number of reasons and a number of things that I've seen, but for

124
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:16,240
 my own family who fled religious persecution in Europe and some members who did not survive.

125
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:26,079
 When they got to the United States, the United States protected me.

126
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,060
 It guaranteed that they could practice their religion, that they could vote, that they

127
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,680
 could do all the things they thought a democracy would provide.

128
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,360
 That's the difference between this country and many other countries.

129
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's my responsibility, it's justice departments responsibility, to ensure that that difference

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,800
 continues, that we protect each other.

131
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:56,040
 Two of your ancestors were murdered in the Holocaust.

132
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
 Yes.

133
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,839
 Is that why you devoted yourself to the law?

134
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,640
 Yes, I would say that's why I devoted myself to the rule of law, to public service, to

135
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,000
 trying and to ensure that the rule of law governs this country and continues to govern this

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 country.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,400
 Merrick Garland has spent a life in the law.

138
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:31,760
 At justice, he oversaw the Oklahoma City bombing case, an act of political terrorism.

139
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,280
 Later, after nearly two decades as a federal appeals court judge, he was nominated to

140
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,520
 the U.S. Supreme Court by President Obama, but Republicans stole the nomination for ten

141
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,800
 months until Donald Trump was sworn in.

142
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,640
 And to elect Biden, picked Garland for attorney general on the same day the Capitol was attacked.

143
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,719
 That became one of the largest investigations in the department's history.

144
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:07,359
 We've arrested and brought charges against more than 1100 people.

145
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:10,680
 There are more to come.

146
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,760
 The videos that every single person happened to have on their phones that security cameras

147
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,280
 had, that bystanders had, that the media had at the time, disclosed faces, some of which

148
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,600
 we have not yet been able to connect to people.

149
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,080
 You're looking for new suspects, new defendants, still.

150
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,080
 Yeah, that's not that they're new suspects, but they are people that we haven't found yet.

151
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,840
 Why do these prosecutions mean so much to you?

152
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,439
 Because this is a fundamental aspect of our democracy.

153
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:45,080
 If we can't ensure that this kind of behavior doesn't recur, it will occur.

154
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,920
 Prosecutions we bring are deterrence against that from happening.

155
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,360
 Garland knows he will be vilified no matter how the Trump and Biden cases are decided.

156
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,400
 His job, he told us, was to take the arrows for the department.

157
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,880
 He has learned to embrace the pain that comes with the job.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,840
 The youngest right now is riot Mitchell, forever eight months old.

159
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,800
 And we saw that at DEA headquarters where he was surrounded by those lost to the opioid

160
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,160
 epidemic and their grieving families.

161
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,199
 Meeting them, he told us, reminds him of why he fights and whom he is fighting for.

162
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:29,000
 Thank you for being here and listening to us.

163
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,240
 I represent the American people.

164
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,760
 I don't represent the president.

165
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,479
 I represent the American people.

166
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,160
 And likewise, I am not Congress's prosecutor.

167
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,359
 I work for the American people.

168
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,640
 And if democracy is an emotional subject for Merrick Garland, maybe it's because he has

169
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:57,040
 witnessed how suddenly it can be threatened in Oklahoma City and Washington, DC.

170
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,040
 When the history of this extraordinary time is written, what is the best that Merrick Garland

171
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
 can hope for?

172
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,360
 Look, I think it's the best.

173
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,800
 Many public servants can hope for that we've done our best that we pass on a Justice Department

174
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,960
 that continues to pursue the rule of law and protect it.

175
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,880
 And it's the same thing that every generation has to hope that we can pass our democracy

176
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:34,800
 on in working order to the next generation that picks up the torch and is responsible

177
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,520
 when we are finished to continue that job.
