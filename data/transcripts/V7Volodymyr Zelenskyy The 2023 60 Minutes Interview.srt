00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 Tonight, Scott Pelley reports from Ukraine, where he sat down with President Vlota Mayor

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,320
 Zelensky in the Capitol key.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,320
 The story will continue in a moment.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,600
 We met President Zelensky as he prepared to depart key for the United States.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,800
 This week he will speak at the UN and meet President Biden.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,840
 It is a critical time.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,480
 The U.S. officials tell us that over nearly 600 days, almost half a million troops have

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,600
 been killed or wounded, both sides altogether.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,480
 Part of the cost so far of Vladimir Putin's unprovoked invasion.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,840
 We spoke to Zelensky on Thursday he told us that his people are dying every day to prevent

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
 World War III.

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 We are defending the values of the whole world, Zelensky said.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,880
 And these are Ukrainian people who are paying the highest price.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,759
 We are truly fighting for our freedom, we are dying.

15
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,500
 We're not fiction, we're not a book, we're fighting for real with a nuclear state that

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,580
 threatens to destroy the world.

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,900
 The United States has contributed about $70 billion to your war effort, and I wonder if

18
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,380
 you expect that level of support to continue.

19
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,140
 The United States of America is supporting Ukraine financially and I'm grateful for this.

20
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,300
 I just think they're not supporting only Ukraine alone.

21
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,340
 If Ukraine falls, Putin will surely go further.

22
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,660
 What will the United States of America do when Putin reaches the Baltic States when he

23
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,820
 reaches the Polish border?

24
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,820
 He will.

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,860
 This is a lot of money.

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
 We have a lot of gratitude.

27
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,500
 What else must Ukraine do for everyone to measure our huge gratitude?

28
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,579
 We are dying in this war.

29
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,540
 If Ukraine falls, what will happen in 10 years?

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,740
 Just think about it.

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,780
 If the Russians reach Poland, what's next?

32
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,220
 A third world war?

33
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
 What will it take?

34
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,420
 Another $70 billion?

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,260
 I don't have an answer.

36
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,420
 The whole world has to decide whether we want to stop Putin or whether we want to start

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,980
 the beginning of a world war.

38
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,220
 We can't change Putin.

39
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,500
 Russian society has lost the respect of the world.

40
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,140
 They elected him and re-elected him and raised a second Hitler.

41
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,739
 They did this.

42
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,940
 We cannot go back in time.

43
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,820
 But we can stop it here.

44
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,620
 Ukraine stopped the Russian advance, but at a terrible cost.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:16,380
 Through and cities, millions of refugees untold thousands of dead, all for Vladimir Putin's

46
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,340
 nation-building vanity.

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,060
 Today, the war is fought on a 700-mile front.

48
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,260
 The red area is the 20% of Ukraine still occupied by Russia.

49
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,060
 This is where Western-donated tanks were supposed to punch through, cutting the Russian force

50
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,420
 in half, but trenches, minefields and artillery stopped the armored advance.

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:48,740
 Now, it's an artillery duel, with each side firing about 40,000 shells a day.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,620
 Ukrainian infantry is advancing bloody yards at a time.

53
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,900
 It's World War I with drones.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,060
 How would you describe the fighting at the front?

55
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,700
 It's a difficult question.

56
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,180
 I'll be completely honest with you.

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,900
 We have the initiative, this is a plus.

58
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:22,420
 We stop the Russian offensive and we moved into a counter-offensive, but despite that,

59
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,220
 it's not very fast.

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,060
 It is important that we are moving forward every day and liberating territory.

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,780
 You have about six weeks of good weather left, and I wonder after that point will the

62
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,380
 front be frozen in place?

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,820
 We need to liberate our territory as much as possible and move forward, even if it's

64
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,420
 less than half a mile or 100 yards, we must do it.

65
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,780
 We can't lose time.

66
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,940
 Forget about the weather and the like.

67
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:00,100
 In places that we can't get through in an armored vehicle, let's fly.

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,219
 If we can't fly, let's send drones.

69
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:08,660
 We mustn't give Putin a break.

70
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,020
 If the front is stationary, Ukrainian drones have vaulted into Russia itself, hitting the

71
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,140
 Kremlin, war planes, and Moscow high-rises.

72
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,820
 Officially, Ukraine does not acknowledge these attacks.

73
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,300
 The drone strikes in Russia are being done on your orders.

74
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
 No.

75
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,060
 No, not on your orders.

76
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,140
 Well, you know, I was just happy.

77
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,700
 But there's a night to show.

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,380
 You know we don't shoot at the territory of the Russian Federation.

79
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,900
 We decided to try the question another way.

80
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,940
 What message is being sent with these drone strikes in Russia?

81
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,900
 Was night to duck somewhere before crystal.

82
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,820
 You do know that we use our partners' weapons on the territory of Ukraine only, and this

83
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,299
 is true.

84
00:05:56,299 --> 00:06:02,859
 But these are not punitive operations, such as they carry out, killing civilians.

85
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:08,900
 But Russia needs to know that wherever it is, whichever place they use for launching missiles

86
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,739
 to strike Ukraine.

87
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:16,179
 Ukraine has every moral right to send a response to those places.

88
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:18,140
 We are responding to them.

89
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:25,380
 Saying, your sky is not as well protected as you think.

90
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,740
 Last winter it was Ukrainian skies that were filled with missiles in a Russian bombardment

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,460
 to destroy power plants.

92
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,300
 Millions shivered in the dark.

93
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,380
 With winter approaching again, Zelensky had this warning.

94
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:48,099
 They must know if you cut off our power, the privus of electricity, the privus of water,

95
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,900
 the privus of gasoline, you need to know.

96
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,700
 We have the right to do it to you.

97
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,900
 Russia takes Zelensky seriously now because Putin's mass invasion was a fiasco.

98
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,860
 The red marks where Ukraine stopped Russia's advance last year.

99
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,300
 It also marks the stain of Russia's war crimes.

100
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,420
 Mr. President, in traveling around Ukraine for the last year and a half, we spoke to people

101
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,540
 in bombed-out schools in Cherneheave.

102
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:33,220
 We've seen destroyed apartment blocks in Borodayanka, a bombed hospital, in Isyam, civilians

103
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,540
 in a mass grave in Buccia.

104
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,660
 These are not military targets.

105
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,780
 What is Vladimir Putin trying to do?

106
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,060
 To break us.

107
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,380
 And by choosing civilian targets, Putin wanted to achieve exactly this.

108
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,260
 To break us.

109
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:04,340
 This person who has made his way with such bloody actions, with everything he has said,

110
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,340
 cannot be trusted.

111
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:13,380
 There is no trust in such a person because he has not been a human being for a long time.

112
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:21,500
 The Russians have suffered grievous losses without resorting to nuclear weapons.

113
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,179
 And I wonder if you believe that the threat of nuclear war is now behind us.

114
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:32,819
 I think he's going to continue threatening.

115
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,100
 He's waiting for the United States to become less stable.

116
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,420
 He thinks that's going to happen during the U.S. election.

117
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,820
 He'll be looking for instability in Europe and the United States of America.

118
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,780
 He will use the risk of using nuclear weapons to fuel that instability.

119
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,860
 He will keep on threatening.

120
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,660
 That U.S. election he mentioned worries him.

121
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,579
 His negotiations with President Biden have been contentious at times, but Zelensky tends

122
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,780
 to get what he asks for.

123
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,060
 Even if, in Zelensky's opinion, it's generally six months too late.

124
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,420
 This week, Zelensky will press Mr. Biden for missiles with longer range.

125
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:26,780
 Congress is debating another $24 billion package.

126
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,220
 And if Ukraine had enough of these modern systems, we would have already restored the territorial

127
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,020
 integrity of Ukraine.

128
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,459
 We would have already done that.

129
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:41,339
 These systems exist.

130
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,939
 We first met Zelensky not long after the invasion, when his office was a blacked-out bunker.

131
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,939
 Now, a year and a half later, we noticed a difference.

132
00:09:52,940 --> 00:10:00,020
 As we were setting up the interview, the former actor used his talent to mask the strain.

133
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,940
 He smiled at a compliment to his wife.

134
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:10,500
 And then instantly he seemed pulled beneath a depth no one can know.

135
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,700
 We don't know what he was thinking.

136
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:19,700
 It looked like empathy for the lost and for those who might be saved.

137
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:30,860
 Our time with Zelensky began in silence, a remembrance of the fallen during a ceremony

138
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,140
 to award medals of valor.

139
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:41,580
 Ukrainian officials tell us Ukraine and Russia have lost their professional armies.

140
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,740
 Now the forces are made up of volunteers, draftees, and in Russia's case prison inmates.

141
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,420
 Zelensky counts his dad in casualty reports each morning.

142
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,180
 You are the president, but it must be humbling to meet those men.

143
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:05,140
 I wonder what they mean to you.

144
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,420
 First of all, it's a great honor for me.

145
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,940
 I look into their eyes and it makes me proud that we have such strong people, because this

146
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,140
 is a big risk, a big risk.

147
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,820
 You can definitely lose your life for the sake of saving other lives.

148
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,740
 And when I say other lives, I don't speak in general.

149
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:32,820
 I mean my own life, the lives of my children, and I understand completely what risks are involved.

150
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:40,300
 That empathy for life has Volodomir Zelensky reaching out again to the United Nations

151
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:47,579
 and the United States, hoping to convince the allies that the world can be safe only

152
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,020
 when Ukraine is whole.

153
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,339
 Can you give up any part of Ukraine for peace?

154
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,660
 No.

155
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,579
 No, this is our territory.

156
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,180
 You must have it all, including Crimea.

157
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:09,900
 Today, you and I,

158
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:13,540
 you said it to me, you saw me awarding people medals.

159
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,140
 Well, today is a day like that.

160
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,660
 A week ago, I gave awards to parents of soldiers who have been killed.

161
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,620
 There were 24 families of the dead.

162
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,740
 There was a woman, she was with three children.

163
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,380
 There were parents very old.

164
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,420
 They could barely walk and they had had only one son.

165
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,260
 One of the women was pregnant.

166
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:42,460
 We arrived holding a baby in her arms and she was pregnant and that baby will never see

167
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:48,380
 what should I tell them that all of them died so that we could say it's okay Russia,

168
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,060
 you can take it all.

169
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,939
 It's a difficult job.

170
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:58,100
 You understand me right?
